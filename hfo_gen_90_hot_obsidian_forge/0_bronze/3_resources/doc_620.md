# HFO HIVE8 — Galois Lattice Diagonal + Anti-Diagonal Workflow (V1)

## Objective

Make the **HIVE/8** scatter/gather turn structure self-documenting and auditable:

- **Diagonal**: the 8 Legendary Commanders (one per port; self-referential identity)
- **Anti-diagonal**: the 4 paired stages (0+7 → 1+6 → 2+5 → 3+4), where each pair sums to **7**

## Diagonal: 8 Legendary Commanders (P0–P7)

| Port | Persona (Legendary Commander) | Verb | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | THE LIDLESS LEGION | OBSERVE | SENSE |
| P1 | THE WEB WEAVER (Swarm Lord of Webs) | BRIDGE | FUSE |
| P2 | THE MIRROR MAGUS | SHAPE | SHAPE |
| P3 | HARMONIC HYDRA | INJECT | DELIVER |
| P4 | RED REGNANT | DISRUPT | DISRUPT |
| P5 | PYRE PRAETORIAN | IMMUNIZE | DEFEND |
| P6 | KRAKEN KEEPER | ASSIMILATE | STORE |
| P7 | SPIDER SOVEREIGN | NAVIGATE | NAVIGATE |

## Anti-diagonal: HIVE/8 Workflow Stages (sum-to-7)

| Stage | Pair | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | P0 + P7 | Hindsight → Alignment (sensor fusion → mission-thread navigation) |
| 1 | P1 + P6 | Insight → Memory (interlocking interfaces → deep recall / exemplars) |
| 2 | P2 + P5 | Validated Foresight → Gate (shape readiness → forensic/defensive gate) |
| 3 | P3 + P4 | Evolution → Feedback (delivery injection → disruption/suppression loop) |

## Scatter/Gather Partition (Double Diamond)

- **SCATTER** ports: P0–P3 (diverge)
- **GATHER** ports: P4–P7 (converge)

## Cardinality Contract (Mosaic Warfare)

- Every port artifact publishes **8^1** items (8 total), indexed with powers-of-two IDs.
- Meta synthesis promotes:
  - P0–P3: **2^1** items (IDs 1 and 2)
  - P4–P7: **8^0** item (ID 1)

This is an identity/structure doc. It must remain stable even as the system answers arbitrary operator prompts.
