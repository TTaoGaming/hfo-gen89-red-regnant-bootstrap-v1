# HFO Grimoire v14 (Chimera)

> *The highest level abstraction of the Hyper Fractal Obsidian (HFO) architecture.*
> *A chimera of the Galois Lattice, the 8 Signature Spells, the Federation Stem-Cell Quine, and the Braided Mission Thread.*

## 1. The Braided Mission Thread (Alpha & Omega)

HFO's primary mission is a braid of two long-lived mission threads that share one commander lattice (P0–P7) and reinforce each other.

- **Thread Alpha (Infrastructure / Survivability)**: The governance and infrastructure thread. Its concern is durability, fail-closed mission engineering, drift prevention, and cognitive persistence.
- **Thread Omega (Gesture Control Plane / Total Tool Virtualization)**: The embodiment and interface thread. Its concern is making digital tool use physical, portable, and reproducible (e.g., MediaPipe gesture control).

### The 8 Legendary Commanders (P0–P7)

| Port | Persona (Legendary Commander) | Verb | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | THE LIDLESS LEGION | OBSERVE | SENSE |
| P1 | THE WEB WEAVER (Swarm Lord of Webs) | BRIDGE | FUSE |
| P2 | THE MIRROR MAGUS | SHAPE | SHAPE |
| P3 | HARMONIC HYDRA | INJECT | DELIVER |
| P4 | RED REGNANT | DISRUPT | DISRUPT |
| P5 | PYRE PRAETORIAN | IMMUNIZE | DEFEND |
| P6 | KRAKEN KEEPER | ASSIMILATE | STORE |
| P7 | SPIDER SOVEREIGN | NAVIGATE | NAVIGATE |

**The Braid Mechanism (Port Lattice)**:
- **P0 + P7 (Evidence ↔ Intent)**: P0 grounds both threads in evidence; P7 selects which thread to prioritize.
- **P1 + P6 (Envelope ↔ Memory)**: P1 wraps events for both threads; P6 assimilates learnings into the shared SSOT.
- **P2 + P5 (Creation ↔ Safety)**: Omega's rapid creation is gated by Alpha's fail-closed immunization.
- **P3 + P4 (Delivery ↔ Challenge)**: Omega delivery is constantly challenged so Alpha can harden doctrine.

## 2. The Dual-Spine Architecture (HIVE8 & PREY8)

The HFO 8-port OBSIDIAN octree has **two** natural pairing topologies that form its dual-spine:

- **HIVE8 (Strategic Spine)**: What we ARE (structural identity). Pairs by anti-diagonal complement (sum-to-7).
- **PREY8 (Tactical Spine)**: What we DO (operational tempo). Pairs by winding path (0+6, 1+7, 2+4, 3+5).

### HIVE8: The Strategic Loop (Anti-Diagonal)

| Stage | Pair | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | P0 + P7 | Hindsight → Alignment (sensor fusion → mission-thread navigation) |
| 1 | P1 + P6 | Insight → Memory (interlocking interfaces → deep recall / exemplars) |
| 2 | P2 + P5 | Validated Foresight → Gate (shape readiness → forensic/defensive gate) |
| 3 | P3 + P4 | Evolution → Feedback (delivery injection → disruption/suppression loop) |

### PREY8: The Tactical Loop (Winding Path)

Every PREY phase spans the scatter/gather boundary, taking one port from each of two adjacent HIVE pairs (a 90-degree rotation of the pairing topology).

| Phase | Pair | Meaning | OODA / MAPE-K Analog |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P**ERCEIVE | P0 + P6 | Present sensing + Past memory = **Full perception**. | Observe / Monitor + Knowledge |
| **R**EACT | P1 + P7 | Tactical data fusion + Strategic command = **Full reaction spectrum**. | Orient + Decide / Analyze + Plan |
| **E**XECUTE | P2 + P4 | Creation + Adversarial testing = **Build AND break in one breath**. | Act (kinetic) / Execute |
| **Y**IELD | P3 + P5 | Delivery + Defense = **Ship AND protect in one breath**. | Act (exploit) / Execute (validation) |

## 3. The OBSIDIAN Octave — 8 Signature Spells

Each port commands a signature spell, formalized with D&D schools and MOSAIC mapping.

| Port | Commander | Spell | School | MOSAIC | Level | Purpose |
|------|-----------|-------|--------|--------|-------|---------|
| P0 | Lidless Legion | **TRUE SEEING** | Divination | SENSE | 6th | Pierce illusions; ground truth audit. |
| P1 | Web Weaver | **FORBIDDANCE** | Abjuration | FUSE | 6th | Boundary enforcement; nothing crosses without a covenant. |
| P2 | Mirror Magus | **GENESIS** | Conjuration | SHAPE | Epic | Create new realities (demiplanes) with defined physics. |
| P3 | Harmonic Hydra | **GATE** | Conjuration | DELIVER | 9th | Open delivery corridors; precision payload on target. |
| P4 | Red Regnant | **WEIRD** | Illusion | DISRUPT | 9th | Adversarial assessment; attack the code's own assumptions. |
| P5 | Pyre Praetorian | **CONTINGENCY** | Evocation | DEFEND | 6th | Fail-closed safety; automated response to drift. |
| P6 | Kraken Keeper | **CLONE** | Necromancy | STORE | 8th | Memory assimilation; perfect recall and resurrection. |
| P7 | Spider Sovereign | **TIME STOP** | Transmutation | NAVIGATE | 9th | C2 steering; freeze the board to align the mission thread. |

## 4. Federation Stem-Cell Quine Manifest

HFO's knowledge survives through **four independent stem-cell quines**. If any single quine survives catastrophe, the full federation can regenerate.

| Glyph | Name | Medium | One-line purpose |
|-------|------|--------|-----------------|
| **α** | **Doctrine Seed** | Single markdown file | Compressed governance + port lattice + invariants (The Grimoire) |
| **Ω** | **Knowledge Library** | Directory of markdown files | Structured tutorials, references, recipes, explanations (Diataxis) |
| **Σ** | **Memory Engram** | SQLite database + embeddings | Searchable atomic memories spanning all eras (SSOT) |
| **Δ** | **Living Code** | Executable specs | Runtime-validatable truth about system behavior (Zod, Playwright) |

**Anti-diagonal rebuild pairs** (fastest recovery path):
- **α↔Σ** — Doctrine seeds memory; memory compresses to doctrine.
- **Ω↔Δ** — Library becomes specs; specs become library.

**Fractal scaling:** 1 survivor → 2 (rebuild partner) → 4 (full federation) → 8 (port-level micro-quines).

## 5. The Heartbeat Mantra (Declarative Gherkin)

The Grimoire is the highest level abstraction of the code. Every action must follow the SW-4 Completion Contract:
- **Given** (precondition)
- **When** (action)
- **Then** (postcondition + evidence)

This declarative Gherkin structure ensures that the Galois Lattice, the Spells, and the Quines are not just theory, but executable, testable, and verifiable reality.
