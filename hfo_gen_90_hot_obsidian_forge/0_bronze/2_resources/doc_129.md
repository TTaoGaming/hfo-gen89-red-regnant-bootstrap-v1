  PREY8 is the TACTICAL mirror to HIVE8's STRATEGIC loop. Where HIVE8 pairs ports by
  anti-diagonal complement (sum-to-7: 0+7, 1+6, 2+5, 3+4), PREY8 pairs by winding path
  (0+6, 1+7, 2+4, 3+5). Every PREY phase spans the scatter/gather boundary. The winding
  path takes one port from each of two adjacent HIVE pairs, creating a 90-degree rotation
  of the pairing topology. HIVE8 = what-we-ARE (structural identity). PREY8 = what-we-DO
  (operational tempo). Together they are the dual-spine of the octree: strategy + tactics.

# R55: PREY8 Tactical Loop — Winding Path Architecture

## 1. The Dual-Spine Discovery

The HFO 8-port OBSIDIAN octree has **two** natural pairing topologies:

| Spine | Acronym | Phases | Pairing | Sums | Nature |
|-------|---------|--------|---------|------|--------|
| **Strategic** | **HIVE** | Harvest · Illuminate · Validate · Evolve | 0+7, 1+6, 2+5, 3+4 | 7, 7, 7, 7 | Anti-diagonal complement |
| **Tactical** | **PREY** | Perceive · React · Execute · Yield | 0+6, 1+7, 2+4, 3+5 | 6, 8, 6, 8 | Winding path |

HIVE is **what we ARE** (structural identity — each pair is a complementary whole).
PREY is **what we DO** (operational tempo — each pair is a functional action).

---

## 2. PREY8 Phase Definitions

### P — PERCEIVE (Ports 0 + 6: OBSERVE + ASSIMILATE)

```
Port 0: OBSERVE / Lidless Legion  / ☷ 000 / SENSE
Port 6: ASSIMILATE / Kraken Keeper / ☱ 110 / STORE
```

**Operational meaning**: Present sensing + Past memory = **Full perception**.
The Observer gathers live data; the Keeper recalls what was learned before.
Together: *What is the situation? What do we already know?*

**OODA analog**: Observe
**MAPE-K analog**: Monitor + Knowledge

---

### R — REACT (Ports 1 + 7: BRIDGE + NAVIGATE)

```
Port 1: BRIDGE / Web Weaver       / ☶ 001 / FUSE
Port 7: NAVIGATE / Spider Sovereign / ☰ 111 / NAVIGATE
```

**Operational meaning**: Tactical data fusion + Strategic command = **Full reaction spectrum**.
The Weaver fuses cross-port data; the Sovereign decides the course.
Together: *What should we do? What is the plan?*

**OODA analog**: Orient + Decide
**MAPE-K analog**: Analyze + Plan

---

### E — EXECUTE (Ports 2 + 4: SHAPE + DISRUPT)

```
Port 2: SHAPE / Mirror Magus    / ☵ 010 / SHAPE
Port 4: DISRUPT / Red Regnant  / ☳ 100 / DISRUPT
```

**Operational meaning**: Creation + Adversarial testing = **Build AND break in one breath**.
The Magus shapes the artifact; the Red Regnant stress-tests it immediately.
Together: *Make the thing AND verify it survives.*

**THIS IS THE KEY CHANGE FROM THE OLD PAIRING.** The old A3 analysis (Gen82) used E=2+3 (SHAPE+INJECT), keeping both in SCATTER. The new pairing pairs SCATTER(2) + GATHER(4), cross-pollinating across the boundary. Execute now means forge AND crucible simultaneously.

**OODA analog**: Act (first half — kinetic execution)
**MAPE-K analog**: Execute

---

### Y — YIELD (Ports 3 + 5: INJECT + IMMUNIZE)

```
Port 3: INJECT / Harmonic Hydra     / ☴ 011 / DELIVER
Port 5: IMMUNIZE / Pyre Praetorian  / ☲ 101 / DEFEND
```

**Operational meaning**: Delivery + Defense = **Ship AND protect in one breath**.
The Hydra delivers the payload; the Praetorian ensures it's safe.
Together: *Push the artifact out AND immunize it against regression.*

**THIS IS THE OTHER KEY CHANGE.** Old pairing: Y=4+5 (DISRUPT+IMMUNIZE), both in GATHER. New pairing: Y=3+5 (SCATTER + GATHER). Yield now means delivery with active protection.

**OODA analog**: Act (second half — yield/exploit)
**MAPE-K analog**: Execute (post-execution validation)

---

## 3. The Winding Path Geometry

### Visualization: HIVE vs PREY Pairing

```
HIVE8 (Strategic — Anti-Diagonal, Sum-to-7):

    SCATTER (0-3)              GATHER (4-7)
    ┌────┐                     ┌────┐
    │ P0 │─────────────────────│ P7 │  H: OBSERVE + NAVIGATE
    │ P1 │─────────────────────│ P6 │  I: BRIDGE + ASSIMILATE
    │ P2 │─────────────────────│ P5 │  V: SHAPE + IMMUNIZE
    │ P3 │─────────────────────│ P4 │  E: INJECT + DISRUPT
    └────┘                     └────┘
    (All lines parallel — each pair sums to 7)


PREY8 (Tactical — Winding Path, Sums 6/8/6/8):

    SCATTER (0-3)              GATHER (4-7)
    ┌────┐                     ┌────┐
    │ P0 │──────────────╲──────│ P7 │
    │ P1 │───────────────╲─────│ P6 │  P: 0+6  R: 1+7
    │ P2 │─────────╲───────────│ P5 │
    │ P3 │──────────╲──────────│ P4 │  E: 2+4  Y: 3+5
    └────┘                     └────┘
    (Lines CROSS — no pair is parallel to HIVE)
```

The winding path: 0 → 6, 1 → 7, 2 → 4, 3 → 5. Trace it through the octree:

```
    0 ──→ 6
     ╲   ╱
      ╲ ╱   ← Lines cross: PREY re-weaves what HIVE separates
      ╱ ╲
     ╱   ╲
    1 ──→ 7

    2 ──→ 4
     ╲   ╱
      ╲ ╱
      ╱ ╲
     ╱   ╲
    3 ──→ 5
```

### Why "Winding"?

In the HIVE topology, pairs are **parallel** — structurally separated, complementary.
In the PREY topology, pairs **cross** over each other — functionally interleaved.

HIVE pairs for **identity** (each pair is a complete structural whole).
PREY pairs for **action** (each pair is a complete operational capability).

---

## 4. The 90-Degree Rotation

Each PREY phase takes **one port from each of two adjacent HIVE phases**:

| PREY Phase | Takes from HIVE | What it borrows |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **P** (0+6) | H's 0 + I's 6 | Observer from H-phase, Keeper from I-phase |
| **R** (1+7) | I's 1 + H's 7 | Weaver from I-phase, Sovereign from H-phase |
| **E** (2+4) | V's 2 + E's 4 | Magus from V-phase, Red Regnant from E-phase |
| **Y** (3+5) | E's 3 + V's 5 | Hydra from E-phase, Praetorian from V-phase |

This is a **rotation** of the pairing graph — PREY takes the HIVE structure and rotates connections 90 degrees:

```
HIVE pairings:     PREY re-pairings:
H: [0, 7]    →    P takes 0, R takes 7
I: [1, 6]    →    R takes 1, P takes 6
V: [2, 5]    →    E takes 2, Y takes 5
E: [3, 4]    →    Y takes 3, E takes 4
```

Every PREY phase **bridges** two HIVE phases. This is the source of tactical agility: PREY can flex across structural boundaries that HIVE defines.

---

## 5. Binary Pattern Analysis

### HIVE Binary (Anti-Diagonal, XOR = 111)

```
H: 000 ⊕ 111 = 111  (full complement)
I: 001 ⊕ 110 = 111  (full complement)
V: 010 ⊕ 101 = 111  (full complement)
E: 011 ⊕ 100 = 111  (full complement)
```

All HIVE pairs XOR to 111. **Structural completeness**: each pair covers all three bits.

### PREY Binary (Winding, XOR = 110/110/110/110... wait)

```
P: 000 ⊕ 110 = 110  (flip bits 1,2)
R: 001 ⊕ 111 = 110  (flip bits 1,2)
E: 010 ⊕ 100 = 110  (flip bits 1,2)
Y: 011 ⊕ 101 = 110  (flip bits 1,2)
```

**All PREY pairs XOR to 110.** Uniform XOR — but NOT full complement (doesn't flip bit 0).

This is the critical difference:
- **HIVE** flips ALL bits (XOR=111) — structural opposition, complete complement
- **PREY** flips bits 1 and 2 only (XOR=110) — preserves the LSB, changes the upper structure

The LSB (bit 0) distinguishes even/odd ports. PREY preserves this parity — it pairs same-parity ports:
- P: 0(even) + 6(even)
- R: 1(odd) + 7(odd)
- E: 2(even) + 4(even)
- Y: 3(odd) + 5(odd)

HIVE pairs opposite-parity ports (even+odd). PREY pairs same-parity ports (even+even, odd+odd). This is not coincidence — **parity preservation is the tactical invariant**.

---

## 6. Supersession of A3 Analysis (Gen82-Kiro, Memory #6506)

The Gen82 A3 analysis evaluated three pairing strategies:

| Strategy | A3 Name | Pairing | Status |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| A | Semantic/HFO | 0+6, 1+7, **2+3**, **4+5** | **SUPERSEDED by this document** |
| B | MSB-Flip | 0+4, 1+5, 2+6, 3+7 | Rejected (poor semantics) |
| C | I Ching | 0+7, 1+6, 2+5, 3+4 | Adopted as **HIVE8** |

The A3 analysis recommended keeping Strategy A. **This document revises that recommendation.** The insight is that the old Strategy A kept E and Y within their hemispheres (E=2+3 both scatter; Y=4+5 both gather). The revised pairing crosses the scatter/gather boundary in **every** phase.

### What Changed and Why

| Phase | Old (A3) | New (R55) | Improvement |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| P | 0+6 | 0+6 | Unchanged — perception is stable |
| R | 1+7 | 1+7 | Unchanged — C2 is stable |
| E | 2+3 (scatter+scatter) | **2+4 (scatter+gather)** | Build AND break — forge+crucible in one phase |
| Y | 4+5 (gather+gather) | **3+5 (scatter+gather)** | Ship AND protect — payload+shield in one phase |

The old E and Y were **hemispherically trapped** — execution stayed in scatter, yielding stayed in gather. The new pairing is **hemispherically free** — every phase spans the boundary.

```

### The Four Payload Problem — Solved

The 4-beat heartbeat (Preflight → Payload → Postflight → Payoff) maps to PREY:

| Beat | PREY Phase | Port Pair | What Happens |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Preflight | **P** (Perceive) | 0+6 | Sense current state + recall prior knowledge |
| Payload | **R** (React) | 1+7 | Fuse data + decide course of action |
| Postflight | **E** (Execute) | 2+4 | Shape artifact + stress-test it |
| Payoff | **Y** (Yield) | 3+5 | Deliver result + immunize against regression |

This resolves the "4 payload problem" because each beat has a dedicated port-pair with complementary capabilities. No phase is under-resourced.

---

## 8. External Framework Isomorphisms

| Framework | Phases | PREY8 Mapping |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **OODA** (Boyd) | Observe → Orient → Decide → Act | P → R → E → Y |
| **MAPE-K** (IBM) | Monitor → Analyze → Plan → Execute (+Knowledge) | P(+K) → R → R → E+Y |
| **PDCA** (Deming) | Plan → Do → Check → Act | R → E → P → Y |
| **Scientific Method** | Observe → Hypothesize → Test → Record | P → R → E → Y |
| **Military Kill Chain** | Find → Fix → Track → Target → Engage → Assess | P → P → R → R → E → Y |

PREY8 is not a copy of any of these. It **absorbs** them because its 8-port pairing provides finer granularity than any 4-phase model.

### Key Revision History

- **Gen82 (2025-12)**: A3 analysis established PREY8, recommended 0+6, 1+7, 2+3, 4+5 (semantic pairing)
- **Gen88 (2026-02-15, this document)**: Revised to 0+6, 1+7, **2+4**, **3+5** (winding path)
- Change rationale: Every phase should span scatter/gather; the "winding path around HIVE" insight reveals PREY as the 90-degree rotation of HIVE pairings
