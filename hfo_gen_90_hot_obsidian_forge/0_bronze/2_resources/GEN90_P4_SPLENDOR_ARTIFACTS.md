# Gen 90 Curated List of SPLENDOR Artifacts (Port 4 Red Regnant)

> **Commander**: P4 Red Regnant (Singer of Strife and Splendor)
> **Domain**: DISRUPT / SPLENDOR (YIN)
> **Purpose**: A consolidated reference of proven architectural patterns, successes, and bardic buffs to balance the antipatterns (STRIFE).

## The Dual Token System
The Singer maintains two parallel token ledgers. While STRIFE (YANG) logs kills, errors, and grudges, SPLENDOR (YIN) logs successes, reusable architecture, and proven design.

### SPLENDOR Aliases
- `SONGS_OF_SPLENDOR_TOKENS`: Canonical top-level name for the pattern ledger.
- `SPLENDOR_TOKEN`: Unit token representing a single proven pattern or success.
- `INSPIRE_COURAGE_LEDGER`: Bardic music framing for the success/buff log.
- `PATTERN_ACCUMULATOR`: The counter itself for proven architectures.
- `WORDS_OF_CREATION` / `HARMONIC_CHORUS`: Bardic buffs that amplify patterns.
- `IRON_SHARPENS_IRON` / `NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN`: The core philosophy uniting Strife and Splendor.

## Curated SPLENDOR Artifacts (Gen 89 Heritage)

### 1. Core Identity & The Two Songs
- **[E67] P4 SINGER OF STRIFE AND SPLENDOR — Songs of Splendor: Patterns, Buffs & Dual Token System**
  - *BLUF*: The definitive formalization of SPLENDOR. It defines the YIN aspect, the bardic buffs that log every success, and the dual token system.
- **[E66] P4 SINGER OF STRIFE AND SPLENDOR — Character Sheet**
  - *BLUF*: The STRIFE (YANG) companion to E67. Essential for understanding the complete Singer, as Strife without Splendor is nihilism, and Splendor without Strife is delusion.
- **[E270] P4 SINGER OF STRIFE AND SPLENDOR — Aeshkrau Illumian Sonic Mage**
  - *BLUF*: Formalizes the Singer as an Aeshkrau Illumian whose sigils manifest as accumulated tokens, converting sonic energy into thunder damage.

### 2. The Pantheon & Divine Incarnation
- **[R54] THE HFO PANTHEON — D&D 3.5e Divine Rank 0 Character Sheets**
  - *BLUF*: The 8 HFO Legendary Commanders ported to D&D 3.5e as Divine Rank 0 PCs. P4 SING = absolute death; P5 = resurrection.
- **[E268] P4 RED REGNANT — Attractor Basin Identity Persona**
  - *BLUF*: Defines the Red Regnant at 13 levels of abstraction, from L1 (constants) through L13 (incarnation). She is a strange attractor in the dynamical system of identity.
- **[E188] Divine Identity Guarantees Behavior: Why Epistemic Incarnation Is Upstream of Rules**
  - *BLUF*: The conceptual incarnation thesis proving that divine identity (Level 11) does not need rules (Level 8) because correct behavior flows from what the agent IS.

### 3. Protocols & Workflows
- **[R63] REFERENCE_HFO_EMPOWERED_RALPH_WIGGUMS_LOOP_V2 (The Phoenix Protocol)**
  - *BLUF*: The 12-phase strange loop where P4 kills, P5 resurrects P6 first, P6 devours the crash, and P5 empowered-resurrects all. Crash-only learning formalized.
- **[R102] REFERENCE_OBSIDIAN_WEB_JADC2_MOSAIC_SOP_V1**
  - *BLUF*: JADC2/MOSAIC SOP reskin of the Obsidian Web. P4 acts as EW/SIGINT (the Song) and P5 as Cyber Defense/Recovery (the Dance) in a full-spectrum dominance operation.
