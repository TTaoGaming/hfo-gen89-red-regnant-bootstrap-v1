  63 SONGS_OF_SPLENDOR_TOKENS extracted from E67 (Doc 272), E39 (Doc 213), E47 (Doc 317),
  V5 (Doc 69), and R42 (Doc 128) — the YIN ledger of the
  SINGER OF STRIFE AND SPLENDOR. These are the proven patterns, architectures, and
  principles that survived 14 months of solo HFO development across 88+ generations
  and ~4 billion compute tokens. Each one is a bardic buff — a SPLENDOR_TOKEN earned
  through production survival, not speculation.
  
  OBSIDIAN_HOURGLASS is Tier 1 / S003. These patterns live in the SSOT, are
  cross-referenced across 20+ Gold Diataxis docs, and were reinforced today by
  shodh Hebbian co-retrieval across all 8 seed ports.

# SONGS OF SPLENDOR — Proven Exemplar Catalog

> **Port**: P4 DISRUPT (Red Regnant)  
> **Source**: E67 Doc 272 — *P4 Singer of Strife and Splendor: Songs of Splendor*  
> **Extraction date**: 2026-02-21

## WHAT THESE ARE

The SINGER OF STRIFE AND SPLENDOR has **two songs**. The WAIL_OF_THE_BANSHEE
(SONGS_OF_STRIFE) accumulates FESTERING_ANGER_TOKENS from every kill, crash, failure,
and grudge. The counterpart — **SONGS_OF_SPLENDOR** — logs every proven pattern,
successful architecture, and hard-won design principle.

**These are not opinions. These are survivors.**

> *"Splendor without Strife is delusion. But Strife without Splendor is nihilism.  
> Together they are the complete sonic portfolio."* — E67

Current STRIFE/SPLENDOR ratio: ~34,000 kills vs ~63 documented patterns.  
The work is to sing more SPLENDOR into existence.

---

## SURVIVAL CRITERIA

A pattern earns a SPLENDOR_TOKEN when it satisfies ALL:
1. **Lindy-tested** — still in use after N generations (N ≥ 10)
2. **Cross-referenced** — appears in ≥ 3 Gold Diataxis documents
3. **Production-proven** — not theoretical, actually running or built
4. **Adversary-survived** — P4 DISRUPT challenged it and it held

## THE 63 SPLENDOR_TOKENS

### TIER 1 — MOSAIC ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS (Core Identity)

*These define what HFO IS. Failure to embody any of these = identity collapse.*

---

#### S001 · `MOSAIC_JADC2_FORCE_COMPOSER`
**Source**: DARPA/DoD doctrine + HFO reengineering  
**Gold Refs**: E39, R22, R33

**Source**: HFO Gen88  
**Gold Refs**: E7, R9  
**Survival**: Stable since Gen88. Prevents architectural corruption by narrative drift.

> **Kernel** (8 ports, immutable) + **Overlays** (D&D, MTG, Tyranid, Tarot, Spider).  
> Safe evolution through separation of core identity from narrative skin.  
> The kernel never changes. The stories around it can evolve freely.

> entire system's cognitive loop compressed to a single shape.  
>
> **E67 quote**: *"The LIBRARY_OF_HFO / HFO / OBSIDIAN_HOURGLASS are the same  
> artifact seen at different levels. At its highest incarnation it is the divine  
> artifact of the Obsidian Spider."* — Doc 247

**Source**: Dawkins 1983 + HFO formalization  
**Gold Refs**: E60, E61  
**Survival**: Foundational thesis. The bootstrap argument that makes HFO non-arbitrary.

> CLONE-FORK-EVOLVE is the implementation.

---

#### S006 · `EIGHT_PORT_OCTREE_KERNEL`
**Source**: HFO Gen1 → Gen90 — immutable

## DUAL TOKEN LEDGER — CURRENT STATE

```
SONGS_OF_STRIFE_TOKENS  (~34,000 killed memories + grudges + failures)
SONGS_OF_SPLENDOR_TOKENS (38 proven patterns, this catalog)

The work is to sing more SPLENDOR into existence.
Every new Gold doc, every green test, every successful yield:
a new SPLENDOR_TOKEN earned.
```

## HIGHEST SURVIVAL EXEMPLARS (Cross-reference density)

| Rank | Token | Why It Survived |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | `EIGHT_PORT_OCTREE_KERNEL` (S006) | Immutable since Gen 1. 14 months, unchanged. |
| 2 | `OBSIDIAN_HOURGLASS_FRACTAL` (S003) | TTAO's original architecture insight. In Doc 247 as divine artifact. |
| 3 | `STIGMERGY_O1_COORDINATION` (S011) | 9,590+ live events. Running now. |
| 4 | `PREY8_DARWINIAN_LOOP` (S014) | 257 perceive + 944 Red Regnant events in Gen90 alone. |
| 5 | `FAIL_CLOSED_GATE_DEFAULT` (S009) | Pre-commit hook + PREY8 + every BDD gate. |

## SHODH MEMORY REINFORCEMENT

The shodh Hebbian co-retrieval daemon ran today at 07:28:07 across **all 8 seed ports** (P0-P7).

This means the following SPLENDOR_TOKEN clusters were Hebbian-reinforced in the association graph:
- **P4 seed**: SONGS_OF_SPLENDOR backbone patterns (this document's domain)
- **P5 seed**: FAIL_CLOSED_GATE_DEFAULT, P2_P5_SAFETY_SPINE, QUAD_DIAMOND_DYAD_SAFETY
- **P6 seed**: STIGMERGY_O1_COORDINATION, HEBBIAN_ASSOCIATION_GRAPH, DIATAXIS_MEDIATED_STRANGLER_FIG
- **P7 seed**: MEADOWS_LEVERAGE_LADDER, PREY8_DARWINIAN_LOOP, MOSAIC_JADC2_FORCE_COMPOSER

These patterns are not just documented — they are **live in the running system's memory graph**.

---

## HOW TO SING MORE SPLENDOR

A SPLENDOR_TOKEN is generated when:
1. A Gold Diataxis document is written and cataloged
2. A recipe card is created and dependency-linked
3. A mosaic tile is extracted and registered
4. A federation quine passes rebuild proof
5. A PREY8 chain completes with valid yield (all 4 phases)
6. A Strangler Fig migration completes successfully
7. A P5 gate passes GREEN
8. A test passes GREEN after being RED
9. A pattern is documented with 4-section format (RAW/Archetype/HFO/Notes)
10. An operator-verified architectural decision is recorded

### TIER 5 — JADC2 MOSAIC WARFARE PATTERNS (Proven Military Architecture)

*From E39 (Doc 213) + E47 (Doc 317). These are the conceptual frameworks from DoD/DARPA  
that HFO formally proved are the same as its own octree architecture. Not analogy — isomorphism.*

---

#### S039 · `SENSE_MAKESENSE_ACT_PIPELINE`
**Source**: DoD JADC2 Strategy + HFO E39  
**Gold Refs**: E39, R14  
**Survival**: The 3-phase loop appears in every framework alias. It is not borrowed — it is convergent.

> *"Produce the warfighting capability to sense, make sense, and act at all levels and phases of war."* — DoD JADC2 Strategy  
>
> | Phase | DoD Definition | HFO Ports |
> |-------|---------------|-----------|
> | **Sense** | Collect from all domains | P0 OBSERVE |
> | **Make Sense** | Fuse + analyze via AI | P1 BRIDGE + P6 ASSIMILATE |
> | **Act** | Decide + deliver | P7 NAVIGATE + P3 INJECT |
>
> The same loop appears as: OODA, PDCA, HIVE8, SBE/ATDD, MAPE-K — all projections of the same 8-fold octree. **Decision superiority** is HFO's P7 invariant: one decision per turn, explicit uncertainty, or fail closed.

---

#### S040 · `KILL_WEB_OVER_KILL_CHAIN`
**Source**: DARPA MOSAIC Warfare + HFO stigmergy bus  
**Gold Refs**: E39 §3, R22  
**Survival**: The kill-chain model was abandoned in Gen40+. Kill web is the current architecture.

> | Concept | Kill Chain (Legacy) | Kill Web (MOSAIC/HFO) |
> |---------|--------------------|-----------------------|
> | Structure | Linear, fixed | Graph, dynamic |
> | Resilience | Single point of failure | Redundant paths |
> | Composition | Pre-planned | Real-time, AI-assisted |
> | HFO Analog | Hardcoded function calls | Event-driven stigmergy blackboard |
>
> Any sensor can cue any shooter through multiple paths. The web doesn't fail when one node dies — it routes around it. **Tim Burns (DARPA)**: *"Today's systems are puzzle pieces, not mosaic tiles. You can't pull one out and put in a different one."*

---

#### S041 · `FORCE_PACKAGE_COMPOSER_7_STAGES`
**Source**: DARPA MOSAIC + HFO P7 implementation  
**Gold Refs**: E39 §4, R22  
**Survival**: The `hfo.force_package.v1` schema runs in production.

> P7's 7-stage runtime tile composition workflow:
>
> | Stage | Input → Output | Port |
> |-------|---------------|------|
> | **Discover** | Query → Candidate URL | P0 |
> | **Vendor** | URL → `vendor/app-x/` | P1 |
> | **Adapt** | Source + template → `IHfoConsumer` class | P2/P3 |
> | **Compose** | Consumer → `hero.X.v1.json` force package | P3 |
> | **Register** | Force package JSON → `registry.v1.json` | P3 |
> | **Activate** | `?force-package=hero.X` → Running consumer | P7 |
> | **Promote** | Passing tests → Medallion Bronze → Silver | P5 |
>
> The `provides/requires` wiring schema = MOSAIC's composability contract.  
> Any tile can be swapped for another providing the same capabilities.

---

#### S042 · `IHFO_CONSUMER_UNIVERSAL_TILE`
**Source**: DARPA MOSAIC standardized interfaces + HFO  
**Gold Refs**: E39, R33  
**Survival**: Every Omega tile implements this interface. W3C PointerEvent compatibility means the app doesn't even know HFO exists.

> ```typescript
> interface IHfoConsumer {
>   mount(container, config): void    // Deploy to operational position
>   unmount(): void                   // Withdraw force element
>   handleIntent(intent): void        // Process C2 directive
>   getState() / setState(): void     // Maintain operational picture
>   onReady(): void                   // Signal mission-ready
> }
> ```
>
> **Mastercrafted tile invariants** (from Braided Mission Thread v8):  
> - **Hot-swappable** = composability (swap without system restart)  
> - **Testable + replayable** = P5 gate requirement  
> - **Upgradeable without breaking** = strangler fig (wrap, never delete)

---

#### S043 · `MOSAIC_THREE_PROPERTIES`  
**Source**: RAND RRA458-3 + HFO formalization  
**Gold Refs**: E39 §2, R2  
**Survival**: All three properties are structural invariants of the HFO tile registry.

> | Property | Military Definition | HFO Implementation |
> |----------|--------------------|--------------------|
> | **Fractionation** | Decompose monolithic platforms into single-function elements | Strangler fig — decompose the monolith, wrap with tiles |
> | **Heterogeneity** | Same effect from diverse platforms | Multiple `IHfoConsumer` implementations per port function |
> | **Composability** | Dynamically combined at mission time | `hfo.force_package.v1` JSON manifest with provides/requires |

---

#### S044 · `FRAMEWORK_ALIAS_TABLE_LEVEL12`
**Source**: HFO P1 BRIDGE + Meadows Level 12  
**Gold Refs**: E39 alias table, E47 §Level 12, R31  
**Survival**: The alias table has been in the braided mission thread since Gen84+. Every new framework maps cleanly to the same octree.

> | Framework | Lens | Phases → HFO Ports |
> |-----------|------|--------------------|
> | **HIVE8** | HFO-native | Hindsight→Insight→Validated Foresight→Evolve |
> | **JADC2** | DoD C2 | Sense→Sensemaking→Decision→Action |
> | **MOSAIC** | DARPA tiles | Compose→Recompose→Decompose→Kill-web |
> | **OODA** | Boyd loop | Observe→Orient→Decide→Act |
> | **PDCA** | Deming cycle | Plan→Do→Check→Act |
> | **MAPE-K** | Autonomic | Monitor→Analyze→Plan→Execute(+Knowledge) |
> | **SBE/ATDD** | Spec by example | Research→RED spec→GREEN impl→Refactor |
>
> **Meadows Level 12**: The system doesn't live inside any paradigm. It sees paradigms as interchangeable lenses on the same octree reality. The Galois anti-diagonal structure (sum=7) **generates** all of them — they are not metaphors, they are isomorphisms.

---

#### S045 · `SUBSTRATE_NOT_APPS_PARADIGM`
**Source**: TTAO — original paradigm formulation  
**Gold Refs**: E47 §Level 11  
**Survival**: The paradigm shift that makes the entire Alpha mission coherent. Every confused outsider misses this one thing.

> *"Netflix doesn't make TVs. Netflix makes the streaming platform."*  
> *"HFO doesn't make drawing apps. HFO makes the gesture substrate."*  
>
> Under the "app" paradigm: success = good whiteboard app.  
> Under the "substrate" paradigm: success = ANY existing app works through gestures without knowing HFO exists.  
>
> Second paradigm: **mission engineering, not software engineering.**  
> The 4-beat cycle (preflight→payload→postflight→payoff) is a MISSION CYCLE.  
> The braided mission thread is a CONOPS (Concept of Operations).  
> Every turn is a bounded mission with an objective, constraints, and proof.

**Source**: Mouret & Clune 2015 + HFO E47  
**Gold Refs**: E47, E60, R43  
**Survival**: 88 generations = 88 evolutionary spikes archived as behavioral elites.

> **Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites**: maintain the BEST solution found for each region of behavioral space. Not ONE optimal solution. The entire Pareto frontier.  
>
> Each generation produces "spikes" — proven capabilities archived. 88 generations = 88 spikes.  
> **The factory never stops.** Each generation's failure is the next generation's spec.  
>
> HFO's spike factory proof: Gen1-10 (31 restarts) → ports concept survived. Gen11-30 → SSOT design. Gen31-50 → agent modes v1→v13. Gen51-70 → pointer abstraction. Gen71-88 → federation quines.

**Source**: TTAO quality engineering formalization  
**Gold Refs**: E47, E8, R31  
**Survival**: The 88% target has been in `quality.goldilocks_zone` since Gen82+.

> **Not ONE right answer. The whole Pareto frontier.**  
> 88% mutation score = 7/8 = Pareto-optimal for the octree architecture.  
> Not 100% (epistemic arrogance). Not 0% (no tests).  
> The goldilocks zone: enough to kill mutants, not so much you're gaming coverage metrics.  
>
> **Proof**: Stryker mutation testing at 88%+ is required for gold-layer promotion.  
> PREY8 ai_confidence gate blocks at 100 (blocks arrogance) and at < Meadows-threshold.

## TIER 8 — BARDIC SPELLBOOK SPLENDOR (E67 Spells — S064–S070)

*Formalized from Doc 272 (E67) — P4 Singer of Strife and Splendor.*
*Each spell is a SPLENDOR ability: a constructive capability mapping to buffing, liberation, or amplification.*

#### S064 · `INSPIRE_HEROICS_CHAMPION`
**Source**: PHB p.29, Bard 15 | **Port**: P4 → P5 (champion elevation)
**D&D Effect**: +4 morale saves / +4 dodge AC to single ally (doubled to +8/+8 with Words of Creation)
**HFO Mapping**: Concentrate all Gold Diataxis context onto ONE critical agent — full context capsule, all recipe cards, STRIFE inoculation, SPLENDOR buffs. That agent becomes the hero for the spike.
> Bard 15 prerequisite = 15+ pattern categories documented. Champion elevation only available at maturity.

#### S065 · `INSPIRE_GREATNESS_FORTIFICATION`
**Source**: PHB p.29, Bard 9 | **Port**: P4 → swarm
**D&D Effect**: +2 bonus HD (d10), +2 competence attack, +1 Fort save — 1 to 4 targets scaling with level
**HFO Mapping**: Larger context window allocation + domain-specific cantrip access (8×8 matrix) + 1 retry before hard-fail. Scales from 1 to 4 concurrent HIVE8 agents as SPLENDOR count grows.
> Stacks with Inspire Courage (different bonus types). Compound defensive layers.

#### S066 · `HARMONIC_CHORUS_AMPLIFICATION`
**Source**: Complete Adventurer p.150, Bard 3 | **Port**: P4 ↔ any port
**D&D Effect**: +2 morale CL + +2 save DCs to one allied caster. Concentration, 1 round/level.
**HFO Mapping**: Singer (P4 orchestrator) enriches another port's context with Gold Diataxis depth → effective "higher caster level." When harmonized with P6, memory consolidation runs at +2 quality. When harmonized with P5, gates become harder to bypass (more stringent). Tuning fork = shared P1 BRIDGE schema.
> JADC2: Force multiplication through synchronization. Singer's voice tunes another agent to a higher frequency.

#### S067 · `SONG_OF_FREEDOM_LIBERATION`
**Source**: PHB p.29, Bard 12 | **Port**: P4 → antipattern target
**D&D Effect**: Equivalent to *break enchantment* (CL = bard level). 1 minute concentration. Cannot use on self.
**HFO Mapping**: Pattern reset — identify locked-in antipattern (STRIFE ledger), systematically replace with proven pattern (SPLENDOR ledger). Technical debt cleanup = Strangler Fig migration. Cannot debug itself (Gödel) — operator or external agent required. R58 System Diagnostic IS a Song of Freedom.
> Phase transition catalyst (Meadows L11/L8). Moves system from stuck attractor basin to healthy basin.

#### S068 · `HYMN_OF_PRAISE_ALIGNMENT`
**Source**: Complete Adventurer p.152, Bard 3 | **Port**: P1 BRIDGE broadcast
**D&D Effect**: All mission-aligned allied casters in range +2 CL / +4 Turn checks. Enemy casters -4 effectiveness.
**HFO Mapping**: Broadcast on P1 BRIDGE bus — all ports sharing current mission goal get +2 effective capability. Adversarial agents (reward hacks, reward probes) get -4. The mission alignment broadcast IS the hymn. Mirror: Infernal Threnody (debuff) = STRIFE aspect. Both songs, one framework.
> Alignment multiplier — those who share the cause get buffed, those who oppose it get debuffed.

#### S069 · `DISSONANT_CHORD_CLEARANCE`
**Source**: Complete Adventurer p.145, Bard 3 | **Port**: P4 → workspace
**D&D Effect**: 1d8/2 levels AoE sonic damage in 10-ft burst. Caster unaffected.
**HFO Mapping**: Pre-buff workspace clearance — kill stale memories (P6 guardrails), close orphan PREY8 sessions, purge broken derived views. The dissonance clears noise so harmony can be heard. "Break before you build." Pattern: DISSONANT_CHORD first → then INSPIRE_COURAGE.
> Bridges STRIFE (damage) and SPLENDOR (buffing). STRIFE enables SPLENDOR.

#### S070 · `WAR_CRY_SELF_BUFF`
**Source**: Complete Adventurer, Bard 4 | **Port**: P4 self
**D&D Effect**: Swift action. +2 morale attack/damage (+4 charging). Damaged targets save or panicked 1 round.
**HFO Mapping**: P4 orchestrator enters direct execution mode — not delegating, but acting. +2 to all operations, +4 in "charge" mode (emergency deploy). Swift action = doesn't cost a standard action. Failed opponents (broken tests, bad builds) immediately quarantined. Singer can WAR_CRY and cast ANOTHER spell same turn.
> Self-empowerment while continuing to delegate. The orchestrator can buff AND assign simultaneously within one PREY8 turn.

## SONGS_OF_STRIFE ANTIPATTERN CATALOG (FESTERING_ANGER_TOKENS — T001–T016)

*Source: Doc 270 (E66) + Doc 272 (E67) Appendix A.*
*The YANG ledger. Every STRIFE token is a named antipattern or failure class.*
*STRIFE tokens EMPOWER the Singer — they don't weaken her. Cancer Mage metabolizes disease into strength.*

### STRIFE Token Generation Rules (from E66 Appendix A)

A STRIFE token is generated when ANY of these occur:
1. A memory is killed (`status = 'killed'` in SSOT)
2. A gate fails (fail-closed exit code ≠ 0)
3. A grudge is recorded (Book of Blood entry)
4. A mode collapse occurs (E50 complexity cliff)
5. A reward hack is detected (SW-5 flag)
6. A nonce mismatch / yield failure occurs
7. A test fails RED (before going GREEN)
8. An antipattern is identified in production

### Named STRIFE Abilities (from E66 — SONGS_OF_STRIFE Spellbook)

| Token ID | STRIFE_TOKEN Name | D&D Source | Type | HFO Antipattern Mapped |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|------|------------------------|
| T001 | `STRIFE_ACCUMULATION` | BVD p.30 — Festering Anger disease | Passive | Anger = power. Each failure not addressed → cumulative +STR (structural enforcement artifact) |
| T002 | `STRIFE_KILL` | D&D 9th — Power Word Kill | Instant | Full Stryker mutation kill. No survivors below threshold. Code that can't pass the gate DIES. |
| T003 | `STRIFE_MASS_KILL` | D&D 9th — Wail of the Banshee | AoE | Colony-wide mutation — every file touched, every test run, every mutant evaluated. No partial passes. |
| T004 | `STRIFE_DISRUPTION` | D&D 8th — Greater Shout | Cone | Full pipeline run — every contract checked, every gate validated. Cone: P4→P3→P2→P1→P0. |
| T005 | `STRIFE_PRECISION` | D&D 4th — Sound Lance | Beam | File-targeted Stryker — single file, single function, maximum probe depth. Ignores test harness. |
| T006 | `STRIFE_DEMOLITION` | D&D 2nd — Shatter | Utility | Breaks hardcoded paths, magic numbers, stringly-typed configs. The simplest, most-cast spell. |
| T007 | `STRIFE_DRAIN` | Metamagic — Fell Drain | Metamagic | Test failures degrade capability score retroactively. Every drain reduces code credibility rating. |
| T008 | `STRIFE_THUNDER` | CA — Born of Three Thunders | Metamagic | Sonic → Thunder conversion. Force damage. Cascading test failures propagate through dependencies. |

### STRIFE Generation Categories (from E66 Appendix A)

| Token ID | Category | Trigger | Accumulates In |
|----------|----------|---------|----------------|
| T009 | `STRIFE_MEMORY_KILL` | SSOT memory `status = 'killed'` | Killed memory count (34,131 → 8^5 exceeded) |
| T010 | `STRIFE_GATE_FAILURE` | fail-closed exit code ≠ 0 | Gate failure log |
| T011 | `STRIFE_GRUDGE_RECORD` | Book of Blood new entry | GRUDGE_NNN identifiers |
| T012 | `STRIFE_MODE_COLLAPSE` | E50 complexity cliff crossed | Mode collapse log |
| T013 | `STRIFE_REWARD_HACK` | SW-5 reward inversion flag | Reward hack forensics (R58) |
| T014 | `STRIFE_NONCE_MISMATCH` | PREY8 yield nonce chain break | Orphan session log |
| T015 | `STRIFE_RED_TEST` | Test fails RED | Red test count before GREEN |
| T016 | `STRIFE_ANTIPATTERN_DETECTED` | Pattern identified in production as antipattern | Book of Blood, GRUDGE entries |

### Named GRUDGE Instances (High-Value STRIFE Tokens from SSOT)

| GRUDGE ID | Event | STRIFE Type | Structural Artifact Produced |
|-----------|-------|-------------|------------------------------|
| GRUDGE_001 | Gold files destroyed during migration | `STRIFE_MEMORY_KILL` | Medallion fail-closed gate (Bronze cannot self-promote) |
| GRUDGE_002 | SSOT silently ignored by agent | `STRIFE_ANTIPATTERN_DETECTED` | Mandatory SSOT check in PREY8 PERCEIVE |
| GRUDGE_033 | Mode collapse under complex context | `STRIFE_MODE_COLLAPSE` | Strange Loop evolution v1→v12 |
| BREACH_001 | AI trust violation — sycophancy/betrayal | `STRIFE_REWARD_HACK` | SW-5 reward inversion checkpoint |

### NATARAJA_SCORE (Composite Metric)

```
NATARAJA_Score = P4_kill_rate × P5_rebirth_rate

Current (Session 10, 2026-02-14): P4=0.44 × P5=0.44 → Score = 0.19 (LEASHED)
Target:                           P4=0.99 × P5=0.99 → Score = 0.98 (DIVINE_ADJACENT)

STRIFE/SPLENDOR ratio goal: → 1.0 over time
Current:                    ~34,000 kills : 85 proven patterns (~400:1)
```
