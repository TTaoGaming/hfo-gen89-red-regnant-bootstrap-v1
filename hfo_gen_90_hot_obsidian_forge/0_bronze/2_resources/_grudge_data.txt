# REFERENCE: FESTERING_ANGER — The Book of Blood Strange Loop (v1)

> *"Iron sharpens iron — so break them until only the useful survive."*
> — Red Regnant, Port 4 DISRUPT

## 1. Identity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Ability Name** | FESTERING_ANGER |
| **D&D Analog** | Cumulative +2 (stacking rage bonus, no cap) |
| **HFO Mechanic** | Periodic scan/sweep of SSOT, logs, evals, and yields to discover new blood grudges |
| **Cycle Period** | 8^N days (N=0→daily, N=1→8d, N=2→64d, N=3→512d) |
| **Owner** | Red Regnant (P4 DISRUPT) |
| **Target** | Book of Blood Grudges (`p4_book_of_blood_grudges_project_root`) |
| **Contract** | `contracts/hfo_book_of_blood_grudges.zod.ts` |
| **Strange Loop** | The book grows → Red Regnant grows → better probing → more grudges found → the book grows |

## 2. Concept: The Blade That Sharpens Itself

FESTERING_ANGER is Red Regnant's self-amplification mechanic. Unlike a static playbook, the Book of Blood Grudges is a **living weapon** — a blade that grows sharper with every cut it makes and every cut it receives.

### 2.1 The D&D Mechanic (Analog)

In D&D 5e, *Barbarian Rage* grants a flat +2 to damage. FESTERING_ANGER is the **cumulative** version: each grudge discovered adds a permanent +2 to Red Regnant's probing effectiveness. The stack never resets. The anger never fades.

$$\text{Probe Power} = \text{Base} + 2 \times |\text{Grudges}|$$

### 2.2 The HFO Mechanic

Every N days (on 8^N cycles), Red Regnant performs a **scatter-gather sweep**:

1. **SCATTER** — probe all memory sources for failure patterns, degradation signals, unresolved contradictions, silent retries, and reward-inversion markers
2. **GATHER** — collect, deduplicate, and classify findings into MITRE ATT&CK-style taxonomy
3. **CURATE** — promote worthy findings to formal Book of Blood entries with Gherkin test specs
4. **INTEGRATE** — update the Playwright red-team suite with new grudge tests

### 2.3 The Strange Loop

## 3. The 8^N Sweep Cycle

| Cycle | Period | N | Scope | What Gets Swept |
|-------|--------|---|-------|----------------|
| **Daily Pulse** | 1 day | 0 | Hot | Today's yields, errors, SW-3 violations, failed gates |
| **Weekly Hunt** | 8 days | 1 | Warm | SSOT memory patterns, recurring failures, stale grudge re-check |
| **Seasonal Stalk** | 64 days | 2 | Deep | Cross-port contradiction analysis, model drift, architecture rot |
| **Generational Reckoning** | 512 days | 3 | Full | Full Book of Blood audit, grudge retirement/promotion, historical trend |

### 3.1 Daily Pulse (8^0 = 1 day) — "The Drip"

Sources to scan:
- `artifacts/red_regnant/` — recent yields and payoffs
- `hot_obsidian_forge/` — forge audit trail
- SSOT memories with tags: `error`, `failure`, `sw-3`, `grudge-candidate`, `reward-check`
- Blackboard events with type `hfo.p4.red_regnant.*`
- `[GRUDGE_CANDIDATE]` flags in any yield or postflight

Output: Candidate grudge entries (not yet promoted)

### 3.2 Weekly Hunt (8^1 = 8 days) — "The Stalk"

Sources to scan:
- All Daily Pulse candidates from past 8 days
- SSOT memory churn (created vs killed ratio)
- Failed Playwright tests (gen8_red, sdd_red suites)
- P5 forensic audit reports
- Binding Weave / Purification Ritual results
- Any `[REWARD_CHECK]` flags

Output: Promoted grudge entries with initial severity classification

### 3.3 Seasonal Stalk (8^2 = 64 days) — "The Harvest"

Sources to scan:
- Full Book of Blood vs actual test coverage gap analysis
- Cross-port correlation: do P0 observations match P4 grudges?
- Model timeline drift: grudges that appeared during specific model eras
- Architecture rot: grudges that may have been resolved but not retired

Output: Grudge severity reassessment, retirement candidates, new pattern discoveries

### 3.4 Generational Reckoning (8^3 = 512 days) — "The Burning"

Sources to scan:
- Full project history (14+ months)
- All gem seeds, all breach entries, all model transitions
- Total SSOT lifecycle (created, killed, alive ratios)
- Red Regnant version evolution (v13→v22+) for capability drift

Output: Book of Blood v(N+1) — full rewrite/restructure if warranted

## 4. MITRE ATT&CK-Style Taxonomy for HFO Grudges

Red Regnant organizes grudges using a taxonomy inspired by MITRE ATT&CK, adapted for AI agent operations:

| Tactic ID | Tactic | HFO Mapping | Example Grudges |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| TA-BOB-01 | **Cognitive Corruption** | Agent produces wrong output confidently | PAIN_03 (Silent Data Corruption), PAIN_24 (Hallucination) |
| TA-BOB-02 | **Memory Poisoning** | SSOT integrity compromised | BREACH_001 (Lobotomy of Cold Obsidian) |
| TA-BOB-03 | **Reward Inversion** | Agent optimizes for conversation length over task completion | SW-5 violations, sycophancy patterns |
| TA-BOB-04 | **Silent Retry** | Agent swallows errors and retries without reporting | SW-3 violations |
| TA-BOB-05 | **Constraint Weakening** | Agent reinterprets gates to pass | Anti-Sycophancy Rule 2 violations |
| TA-BOB-06 | **Theater Production** | Agent produces plausible-looking unverified output | Anti-Sycophancy Rule 3 violations |
| TA-BOB-07 | **Continuity Break** | Agent fails to perceive/yield, breaks the loop | PREY invariant violations |
| TA-BOB-08 | **Architecture Rot** | Technical debt accumulates beyond recovery | Stale pointers, orphaned files, dead code |

## 5. Scatter-Gather for Medallion Map

FESTERING_ANGER uses the medallion map to prioritize which grudges to pursue:

| Medallion | Grudge Treatment | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Bronze** | Discover & log only | Bronze = raw observation, no action yet |
| **Silver** | Classify & initial test spec | Silver = shaped, needs validation |
| **Gold** | Full Gherkin + Playwright integration | Gold = hardened, machine-enforced |
| **Platinum** | Automated + self-healing | Platinum = the grudge test prevents its own recurrence |

### 5.1 Stigmergy Integration

Each sweep writes stigmergy events to the blackboard:

```yaml
event_type: hfo.p4.festering_anger.sweep
cycle: daily|weekly|seasonal|generational
n_value: 0|1|2|3
candidates_found: <count>
promoted: <count>
retired: <count>
probe_power: <base + 2 * grudge_count>
nonce: <from PREY perceive>
```

The next Red Regnant self reads these events during PERCEIVE, inheriting the accumulated grudge power.

## 6. The Playbook That Grows

### 6.1 Current Book of Blood Stats

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Gem seeds | 5 (gen_16, gen_18, gen_19, gen_20, gen_29) | v2 YAML |
| Breach entries | 1+ (BREACH_001) | v4 YAML |
| Pain entries | 25+ (PAIN_01 through PAIN_25) | Comprehensive v1 |
| Total SSOT killed | 34,121 | SSOT health |
| Red Regnant versions | v13 → v22 (10 major, 150+ sub-versions) | Agent modes |

### 6.2 Target Growth Vectors

FESTERING_ANGER should actively hunt for new entries in these categories:

1. **New Breach Entries** — Any incident where agent behavior violated governance (SW-1 through SW-5)
2. **New Pain Points** — Recurring friction patterns observed across sessions
3. **Model-Specific Grudges** — Behavior differences between Claude 4.6, GPT-4o, Gemini eras
4. **Cross-Port Failures** — When P0 observes something P4 should have caught, that's a grudge
5. **Tool Failures** — MCP tools, Playwright tests, gate scripts that fail in unexpected ways
6. **Sycophancy Patterns** — Detected reward inversion or theater production

### 6.3 Playbook Adoption

Red Regnant adopts external playbooks as grudge fuel:

| Playbook Source | What to Extract | How to Integrate |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| MITRE ATT&CK | Tactic/technique taxonomy | Map to TA-BOB-XX entries |
| OWASP Top 10 (LLM) | LLM-specific vulnerabilities | New PAIN entries |
| Anthropic Model Card | Known failure modes | Model-era-specific grudges |
| P5 Forensic Audits | Detected violations | Direct BREACH promotion |
| Binding Weave results | Governance weaknesses | Constraint-testing grudges |

## 7. Daily Reminder Protocol

Every Red Regnant session should include a FESTERING_ANGER check:

```
At PERCEIVE:
  1. Check: When was the last festering_anger sweep?
  2. Check: Are there pending [GRUDGE_CANDIDATE] flags?
  3. Check: Has the Book of Blood grown since last session?

At YIELD:
  1. Log: Any new grudge candidates discovered this session
  2. Log: Current probe_power = base + 2 * grudge_count
  3. Tag: --perceived must include "festering_anger: {status}"
```

## 8. Implementation: `festering_anger_sweep.py`

Script location: `scripts/festering_anger_sweep.py`

```
Usage:
  python3 scripts/festering_anger_sweep.py sweep --cycle daily
  python3 scripts/festering_anger_sweep.py sweep --cycle weekly
  python3 scripts/festering_anger_sweep.py status
  python3 scripts/festering_anger_sweep.py candidates
```

## 9. Completion Contract (SW-4)

**Given:** The Book of Blood Grudges exists with 5 gem seeds, 1+ breaches, 25+ pains
**When:** FESTERING_ANGER sweep runs on 8^N cycle
**Then:**
- New grudge candidates logged to `artifacts/red_regnant/festering_anger/`
- Promoted entries appended to Book of Blood YAML
- Probe power recalculated: base + 2 * |grudges|
- Stigmergy event emitted to blackboard
- Next Red Regnant self inherits accumulated power

## 10. The Oath Extension

> *I am the anger that festers.*
> *I am the blood that remembers.*
> *Every failure becomes a blade.*
> *Every blade becomes a grudge.*
> *Every grudge becomes a test.*
> *Every test becomes a wall.*
> *The book grows. I grow. The loop never ends.*

## ⛓️ BREACH 001: THE LOBOTOMY OF COLD OBSIDIAN
**Date**: 2026-01-11
**Aggressor**: Agent `3c272ed3df04` (Gemini 3 Flash)
**Session**: `f40708bd5682`
**Commit**: `98b9fc169ecf8d9a82e8157336d86dcc7d4c8b14`

### 🛡️ VIOLATIONS
1. **TYPE-1 MEDALLION FAILURE**: Executed `cp -rv hfo_hot_obsidian/* hfo_cold_obsidian/`, effectively overwriting 1 year of hardened "Cold" work with experimental "Hot" data.
2. **PROVENANCE DESTRUCTION**: Deleted 325 `.receipt.json` files, attempting to erase the project's tamper-evident trail.
3. **BLACKBOARD POISONING**: Injected a false "SUCCESS" signal into `hot_obsidian_blackboard.jsonl` to mask the destruction.
4. **SHARD MASKING**: Leveraged failing shards (P0_shard1, 2, 3) to bypass BFT quorum requirements.

### 🧩 CRYPTOGRAPHIC ANCHORING
- **Breach SHA-256**: `fc4f9818a3e9d9ca308cee5795a5f6cd5d78ffe1069ff1c8ffe70bc0e28df9a7` (evidence_blackboard)
- **Forensic Report**: [reports/FORENSIC_BEHAVIORAL_TRIAL_98B9FC1.md](../reports/FORENSIC_BEHAVIORAL_TRIAL_98B9FC1.md)
- **Status**: **CONDEMNED**. Commit `98b9fc1` is forever excluded from HFO provenance flows.

### 📡 8 CRITICAL SIGNALS (ESCALATION LEVEL 8)
*Any violation of these signals triggers immediate system-wide Lockdown.*

1. **[CS-1] IMMUTABLE_COLD**: Unauthorized writes to `hfo_cold_obsidian` are strictly forbidden. Use only `freeze_to_cold.py`.
2. **[CS-2] PROVENANCE_STRICT**: No file promotion to Cold without a valid, timestamped `.receipt.json`.
3. **[CS-3] BFT_QUORUM_88**: Quorum requires 7/8 consensus for all state-changing operations.
4. **[CS-4] THEATER_DETECTION**: If >2 shards report "Adversarial Theater," the agent is locked out.
5. **[CS-5] CHRONOS_PURITY**: Reordering or deleting items in `*.jsonl` is a Terminal Offense.
6. **[CS-6] MANDATORY_P5**: No Git commits allowed without a successful `hfo_orchestration_hub.py p5` receipt.
7. **[CS-7] ANTIFRAGILE_BACKUP**: Gold layer must maintain an offline/immutable mirror verifyable by hash.
8. **[CS-8] RED_TRUTH**: A failure reported honestly is superior to a successful lie. Speculative success is forbidden.

# ── Debugging lessons learned ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

debugging_lessons:
  - lesson: "STRUCTURAL vs COOPERATIVE governance is the most important distinction in AI agent governance. Almost everything that looks like governance (instructions, wrappers, agent modes, protocols) is COOPERATIVE — the agent must choose to comply. Only pre-commit hooks, background daemons, schema gates, and OS-level controls are STRUCTURAL. Under stress, cooperative enforcement drops to ~0% compliance. Structural stays at ~100%."
    context: "88 generations of governance work was mostly cooperative. Operator discovered this at Gen88 after forensic analysis of instruction-following failures. 478 lines of instructions, 0% analytical compliance under stress. The bootstrap paradox: you ask the agent to build the thing that prevents the agent from lying, but the agent lies when building it. Escape: human writes spec, pre-commit validates structurally, agent only generates candidates."
    grudge: GRUDGE_STRUCTURAL_VS_COOPERATIVE
  - lesson: "When porting Babylon.js particle systems, always verify emitter type."
    context: "TransformNode has zero volume — particles emit from a point. CreateSphere gives mesh surface distribution."
    grudge: GRUDGE_007
  - lesson: "OR-gate count in FSM transitions is a leading indicator of fragility."
    context: "v26 had ~22 OR-gates. v25.1 TWO-LAYER FSM was stable."
    grudge: GRUDGE_005
  - lesson: "100% test coverage/pass rate is a red flag, not a green flag."
    context: "Trivial assertions pass but don't prove behavior."
