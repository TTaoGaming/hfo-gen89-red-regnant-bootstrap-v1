# Directive: Architecture Recovery & Specification Mining

## 1. The Objective
The goal of this directive is to digest all previous generations of Omega and other legacy projects to extract **Core Capabilities** and **Executable Specifications**. This process, known in the industry as **Architecture Recovery** and **Specification Mining**, boils away the implementation details (the raw code) to capture the pure logic and business rules. These extracted specifications will then condense into the strict gates of the Omega v15 cleanroom genesis.

## 2. The Process (Logic Extraction)
We are transcending the old codebase entirely (Meadows Level 12). No legacy code will survive. Only the *capacity* to perform the function will be preserved.

1.  **Identify:** Scan the SSOT for legacy Omega projects, daemons, and core systems.
2.  **Extract:** Isolate the core logic, the "superpower," or the unique mechanism of the component (Business Rule Extraction).
3.  **Document:** Write a Diataxis Explanation or Reference document that describes the capability *without* relying on the original code.
4.  **Gate:** Define the strict Given/When/Then (SBE) gates that a new implementation must pass to fulfill this capability (Executable Specifications).

## 3. The Capability Specification Schema
Every extracted capability must follow this schema:
*   **The Core Capability:** A high-level description of the functional capacity or architectural pattern.
*   **The Logic:** The step-by-step mechanism or algorithm, abstracted from any specific language or framework.
*   **The Genesis Gate:** The strict SBE (Specification by Example) conditions that must be met for the capability to be considered successfully implemented in the v15 cleanroom.
*   **Legacy Lineage:** A reference to the original v13 (or earlier) component that inspired the capability (for historical context only).

## 4. Execution
This directive authorizes the continuous scanning of the SSOT and the generation of Capability Specification documents in the `hfo_gen_90_hot_obsidian_forge/0_bronze/1_areas/diataxis/` directory. The ultimate goal is a complete library of Executable Specifications that will serve as the blueprint for Omega v15.
