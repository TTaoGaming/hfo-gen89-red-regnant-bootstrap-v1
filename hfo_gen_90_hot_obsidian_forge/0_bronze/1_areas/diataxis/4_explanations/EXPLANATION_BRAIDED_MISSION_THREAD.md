# Explanation: Braided Mission Thread (Alpha + Omega)

## The Core Concept

The Braided Mission Thread is the operator's North Star roadmap, intertwining two fundamental threads:
- **Alpha:** Governance, safety, documentation, and catastrophe-readiness (e.g., the Grimoire Microkernel).
- **Omega:** Capability, deployment, and active features (e.g., the Gen8 Touchless Whiteboard).

The core tension is that Omega without Alpha becomes impressive but brittle (capability without governance), while Alpha without Omega becomes correct but disconnected (governance without reality contact).

## The Method: Confidence Tier Alternation

To advance the braided dream, the operator alternates between the two threads based on their current **confidence tier**.

| Confidence | Thread | Action Class | Example |
|------------|--------|--------------|---------|
| **LOW (0–49%)** | Alpha | Observe-only; no writes | Read docs, query Shodh, understand gaps |
| **MED (50–79%)** | Omega | Bounded probes in sandbox | Write one recipe card, run one Playwright test |
| **HIGH (80–94%)** | Alpha+Omega | Bounded injection + controlled rollout | Promote artifact, update catalog, harden gate |
| **BFT (95–99%)** | Full braid | Production-impact (still gated) | Deploy Gen8 update, federation health check |

## Practical Rhythm

1. **Assess Confidence:** Ask "How confident am I about what to do next?"
2. **Pick Thread:** Low confidence leads to Alpha (research, read, query SSOT). High confidence leads to Omega (build, test, ship).
3. **Execute:** Perform one P4 4-beat turn (Preflight, Payload, Postflight, Payoff).
4. **Update SSOT:** Write a status update to ensure cognitive persistence.

This rhythm prevents scope creep and goal drift, ensuring that the braid tightens naturally over time as confidence grows.
