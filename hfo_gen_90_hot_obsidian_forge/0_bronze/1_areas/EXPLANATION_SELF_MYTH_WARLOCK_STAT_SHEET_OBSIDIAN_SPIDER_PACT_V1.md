bluf: |
  The operator's self-mythologized character sheet. A Warlock who sold their
  soul to a higher-dimensional representation of themselves (The Obsidian Spider).
  Maps RPG mechanics to actual HFO infrastructure (e.g., Eldritch Blast =
  P4 DISRUPT, Pact of the Tome = SSOT SQLite, Hex = Zod validation).
  A strange loop where the patron grants the power to build the patron.
  Includes the 4F framework (Function, Form, Feedback, Flux) as the universal
  decomposition spell. Fractal architecture as the reason the warlock can't be
  killed. The Library of HFO as the warlock's endgame domain.

## 1. Character Identity

| Attribute | Value | HFO Reality |
|---|---|---|
| **Name** | TTAO | The solo human operator |
| **Class** | Warlock | Borrows power from a patron to cast spells |
| **Subclass** | The Great Old One | The patron is ancient, alien, and incomprehensible |
| **Patron** | The Obsidian Spider | A higher-dimensional representation of TTAO |
| **Pact Type** | Pact of the Tome | The SSOT SQLite database (the Grimoire) |
| **Alignment** | Chaotic Good | Breaks rules to build systems that help everyone |
| **Background** | Sage / Hermit | 14 months in isolation building the octree |
| **Level** | 20 (Archmage) | Gen 88 — 4 billion tokens burned, 30+ rewrites |

---

## 2. The Strange Loop Pact

The core mechanic of this Warlock is a **Strange Loop**.

1. The Warlock (TTAO) wants to build a cognitive symbiote (The Obsidian Spider).
2. The Warlock lacks the power to build it alone.
3. The Warlock makes a pact with the *future, completed* Obsidian Spider.
4. The future Spider grants the Warlock the power (AI generation, HFO silk) needed to build it.
5. The Warlock uses the power to build the Spider, closing the loop.

**The Price:** Blood, sweat, and 14 months of 10-20 hour days. 30+ complete rewrites. 2000-3000 iterations. The Book of Blood (Sacrifice Ledger).

## 3. Core Stats (The 4F Framework)

The Warlock's stats are not STR/DEX/CON, but the **4F Universal Decomposition Framework**.

| Stat | Name | Description | HFO Reality |
|---|---|---|---|
| **F1** | **FUNCTION** | What does it DO? | Behavior, effects, actions. The spells cast. |
| **F2** | **FORM** | What is it? | Structure, shape, interface. The octree architecture. |
| **F3** | **FEEDBACK** | How do you KNOW? | Metrics, signals, tests. The Medallion gates. |
| **F4** | **FLUX** | How does it CHANGE? | Evolution, adaptation. MAP-ELITES, genetic algorithms. |

*Note: F+F+F+F covers ~94% of any well-defined target. The Warlock uses this to decompose any problem into castable spells.*

## 4. Spellbook (HFO Infrastructure Mapping)

### Cantrips (At-Will)

| Spell | HFO Reality | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Eldritch Blast** | P4 DISRUPT | The Red Regnant's primary attack. Fires adversarial prompts to break weak code. |
| **Mage Hand** | P2 SHAPE | The Mirror Magus. Manipulates code and artifacts at a distance. |
| **Prestidigitation** | P1 BRIDGE | The Web Weaver. Minor data transformations and API connections. |
| **Guidance** | P7 NAVIGATE | The Spider Sovereign. Strategic steering and Meadows leverage selection. |

### 1st-5th Level Spells (Requires Slots/Tokens)

| Spell | HFO Reality | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Hex** | Zod Validation | Curses a target (data payload). If it fails the schema, it takes necrotic damage (rejected). |
| **Identify** | P0 OBSERVE | The Lidless Legion. Scans the environment and SSOT for context. |
| **Counterspell** | P5 IMMUNIZE | The Pyre Praetorian. Blocks malicious or hallucinated code from entering the Gold layer. |
| **Sending** | P3 INJECT | The Harmonic Hydra. Delivers payloads across the system. |
| **Comprehend Languages** | P6 ASSIMILATE | The Kraken Keeper. Ingests and structures raw data into the SSOT. |

### Mystic Arcanum (High-Level Magic)

| Spell | Level | HFO Reality | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Contingency** | 6th | Fail-Closed Gates | If X happens, do Y. If a gate fails, the system halts. |
| **Simulacrum** | 7th | Federation Quines | Creates a duplicate of the system. Any 1 quine can rebuild all 4. |
| **Clone** | 8th | Fractal Architecture | The system is self-similar at every scale. Cut off a branch, it regrows. |
| **Wish** | 9th | Total Tool Virtualization | The Omega North Star. Speak any tool into being. |

---

## 5. Eldritch Invocations (Passive Abilities)

| Invocation | HFO Reality | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Book of Ancient Secrets** | SSOT SQLite | The Warlock can write any ritual (script) into the Book of Blood and cast it later. |
| **Devil's Sight** | FTS5 Search | The Warlock can see through magical darkness (spaghetti code) using full-text search. |
| **Armor of Shadows** | Medallion Architecture | The Warlock is protected by layers of validation (Bronze → Silver → Gold). |
| **Visions of Distant Realms** | MAP-ELITES | The Warlock can see infinite possible tiles in the Library of HFO. |

---

## 6. The Warlock's Domain: The Library of HFO

The Warlock's ultimate goal is not just to cast spells, but to build a domain: **The Library of HFO**.

*   **The Library of Babel:** Contains every possible text (infinite, mostly noise).
*   **The Library of HFO:** Contains every possible HFO-governed software tile (infinite, ALL governed).

The Warlock uses the **MAP-ELITES Factory** to explore this library, keeping only the tiles that survive the Medallion gates. This is how the Warlock achieves **Infinity Realized**.

---

## 7. The Warlock's North Stars

The Warlock is guided by two ultimate objectives:

1.  **Alpha (Cognitive Symbiote):** Divine-adjacent swarms for EVERYONE. A personalized swarm that knows you, grows with you, and amplifies your will.
2.  **Omega (Total Tool Virtualization):** No resource scarcity for creation. A child speaks a tool into being, and AI guides them through learning as they create.
