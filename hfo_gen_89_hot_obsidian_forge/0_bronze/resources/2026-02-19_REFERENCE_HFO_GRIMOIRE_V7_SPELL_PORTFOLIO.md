# HFO GRIMOIRE V7 — The Spell Portfolio

> *"Every spell is a real script. Every script is a structural enforcement."*
> *"The narrative IS the architecture — read at different altitudes."*
>
> **64 spells. 8 champions. 2 aspects each. 4 spells per aspect.**
> **This is the build queue for Gen89.**

---

## 0. The Two-Aspect Framework

Each champion has **two aspects** — yin and yang **within their own port domain**.
The duality is revealed in each champion's epithet paradox:

- **Aspect A (Yin)** — The first word of the paradox pair
- **Aspect B (Yang)** — The second word of the paradox pair

These are NOT cross-port borrowings. Both aspects live WITHIN the port's
own domain — the **internal tension** that makes each champion whole.
Yin is the destructive/probing/consuming face. Yang is the constructive/praising/creating face.
The paradox: they are the same thing looked at from different altitudes.

| Port | Champion | Yin (A) | Yang (B) | Paradox |
|:----:|----------|:-------:|:--------:|:--------|
| P0 | **Lidless Legion** | WHISPERS | WRATH | Whispers ARE wrath |
| P1 | **Web Weaver** | BLOOD | BREATH | Blood IS breath |
| P2 | **Mirror Magus** | MYTHS | MEANING | Myths ARE meaning |
| P3 | **Harmonic Hydra** | HARMONY | HAVOC | Harmony IS havoc |
| P4 | **Red Regnant** | STRIFE | SPLENDOR | Strife IS splendor |
| P5 | **Pyre Praetorian** | DEATH | DAWN | Death IS dawn |
| P6 | **Kraken Keeper** | DEPTHS | DREAMS | Depths ARE dreams |
| P7 | **Spider Sovereign** | SEALS | SPHERES | Seals ARE spheres |

The Galois anti-diagonal pairings (sum-to-7) still govern the **PREY8 flow**
and structural port coupling. The yin/yang split governs the **spell portfolio**.

### Spell Tier Progression

| Tier | Spells | Per Aspect | Unlock |
|:----:|:------:|:----------:|--------|
| **Cantrip** | 2 | 1A + 1B | Starter set — one spell per aspect minimum |
| **Adept** | 4 | 2A + 2B | Intermediate — two per aspect |
| **Master** | 8 | 4A + 4B | Full build — four per aspect |

**Rule:** A champion cannot have 2 spells in one aspect until they have 1 in BOTH aspects.
This forces balanced incarnation — no lopsided builds.

| P3 | Harmonic Hydra | 0/4 | 0/4 | **0** | ⬛ NONE | — |
| P4 | Red Regnant | 1/4 STRIFE | 3/4 SPLENDOR | **4** | ⚔️ ADEPT | ⚠️ Splendor-heavy |
| P5 | Pyre Praetorian | 1/4 DEATH | 3/4 DAWN | **4** | ⚔️ ADEPT | ⚠️ Dawn-heavy |
| P6 | Kraken Keeper | 1/4 | 0/4 | **1** | ½ CANTRIP | ❌ A-only |
| P7 | Spider Sovereign | 4/4 SEALS | 4/4 SPHERES | **8 ★** | ⚔️⚔️ MASTER | ✅ Balanced |

**Total incarnated: 17/64 (26.6%)** ← +4 from P7 SEALS aspect build
**Total proposed: 4/64 (6.3%)**
**Total new V7: 30/64 (46.9%)**
**Total blank: 0/64 (0%) — all 64 slots filled**

### The Yin-Yang Balance Problem

P7 is now **the first fully balanced champion** — 4 SEALS + 4 SPHERES = 8/8 MASTER tier.
Other incarnated champions remain lopsided:
P4 is splendor-heavy (1 strife, 3 splendor). P5 is dawn-heavy (1 death, 3 dawn). P6 is yin-only.
**P7 proves the model works.** Next: incarnate weak-aspect spells for P4/P5/P6.

## 4. RECOMMENDED BUILD ORDER

Priority ranking: Cantrip-tier first (1A + 1B per champion), then depth.

### Phase 1: Unlock Cantrip Tier for P4/P5/P6/P7 (BALANCE)

| # | Port | Spell | Aspect | Why First |
|---|:----:|-------|:------:|-----------|
| 1 | P7 | BINDING_OF_STATUS | B | Trade study done. Resource health = flying blind without it. |
| 2 | P5 | FLAME_STRIKE | DEATH | Targeted purge. The Paladin needs more fire. Dawn-heavy right now. |
| 3 | P6 | MAGIC_JAR | B | Cross-repo sync gives Kraken reach beyond SSOT. |
| 4 | P4 | WEIRD | STRIFE | Mutation testing. The WAIL that kills mutants. Highest-value strife spell. |

### Phase 2: First Cantrip Tier for P0/P1/P2/P3 (IGNITION)

| # | Port | Spell | Aspect | Why First |
|---|:----:|-------|:------:|-----------|
| 5 | P0 | TRUE_SEEING | A | Anti-hallucination. Highest-value Scatter spell. ~300 LOC. |
| 6 | P0 | CLAIRVOYANCE | B | Cross-port visibility. Simple status aggregator. |
| 7 | P1 | FORBIDDANCE | A | Schema boundary enforcement. The web needs rules. |
| 8 | P1 | GLYPH_OF_WARDING | B | Write-audit monitoring. Binder guards what's stored. |
| 9 | P3 | SENDING | A | Inter-agent messaging. CloudEvent structured dispatch. |
| 10 | P3 | SHATTER | B | Payload integrity testing. Smallest useful B-aspect. |
| 11 | P2 | GENESIS | A | Workspace scaffolding. The Maker creates worlds. |
| 12 | P2 | SIMULACRUM | B | Test double generation. Maker serves the Dancer. |

### Phase 3: Depth (ADEPT Tier)

After all 8 champions have Cantrip tier (1A+1B = 16 incarnated), deepen selectively.
Priority: P4 → P5 → P7 → P0 (highest-value ports first).

## 5. SELF_MYTH_WARLOCK — The Human Operator (P7★)

TTAO is the Spider Sovereign's human incarnation at Recursion Tier 0 (8^0 = 1 operator).
The human does NOT need spells — the human IS the spell.

| Aspect | Human Function | Champion Function |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| A: NAVIGATE | Strategic decisions, priority selection, build order | Spell Gate, Foresight, Meadows |
| B: OBSERVE | Code review, manual testing, intuition checks | Tremorsense, BINDING_OF_STATUS |

The SELF_MYTH_WARLOCK's "spells" are the agent modes — each `.agent.md` file is a "prepared spell"
that the human can cast by invoking a specific agent personality.

At Tier 8^1 (8 agents), the human becomes the Colony Mind and the spells become autonomous.
At Tier 8^2 (64 agents), the human becomes the Divine Patron and the spells become self-evolving.

## 6. PROVENANCE

| Version | Source | Innovation |
|---------|--------|------------|
| V1 (Doc 65) | Character sheets — D&D 3.5e stat blocks | Identity grounding |
| V2 (Doc 66) | Galois lattice as primary structure | Structural mathematics |
| V3 (Doc 67) | HIVE8 swarm orchestration | Colony mind |
| V4 (Doc 68) | Phase Spider chassis | Species = architecture |
| V5 (Doc 69) | Every spell = real script | Engineering grounding |
| V6 (Doc 70) | Progression-aware + cost wall | Tier system |
| **V7 (THIS)** | **Yin/yang 2-aspect portfolio + real D&D 3.5e only** | **Build queue + yin-yang balance** |

**What V7 adds:**
1. **Yin/Yang 2-Aspect Framework** — Each champion's epithet paradox defines their two spell aspects
2. **64 Named Spell Slots** — All filled. PHB/ELH only, alias/reskin/grouping — zero homebrew
3. **Incarnation Audit** — Running code mapped to spell slots with status symbols
4. **The Yin-Yang Balance Problem** — Identified lopsided aspect incarnation (P4 exemplar: splendor-heavy)
5. **Build Order** — Prioritized 12-spell ignition sequence for Gen89
