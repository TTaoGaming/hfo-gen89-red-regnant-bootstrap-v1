  HFO_ALTER_REALITY is the L11 paradigm shift from a single "wish" spell to a continuous, 
  correct-by-construction pipeline. It transforms operator intent into a MAP-ELITE portfolio 
  of SOTA, shippable mosaic tiles using the 8-port octree, SBE towers, and the 6-defense SDD stack.

## 1. The L11 Paradigm Shift: From Spell to Pipeline

The original concept of `HFO_WISH` was a spell—a single, powerful invocation to change state. However, operating at **Meadows Level 11 (Paradigm)** requires a shift in thinking. We do not want a single artifact; we want an **evolutionary portfolio**.

`HFO_ALTER_REALITY` is the realization of the P7 Yin Salient Divine Ability (SDA). It is not a script; it is the **entire PREY8 loop** acting as a continuous, correct-by-construction pipeline.

### The Goal
Transform plain-language operator intent into **SOTA, shippable software mosaic tiles** that connect, synergize, and evolve via a MAP-ELITE (Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites) portfolio.

---

## 2. The Pipeline Architecture (The 8-Port Octree)

The pipeline leverages the existing HFO 8-port lattice to guarantee correctness at every step.

### Phase 1: Intent to Engineering (P0 → P1 → P2)
1. **P0 OBSERVE (Sensing):** The operator's plain-language intent is ingested. The Lidless Legion queries the SSOT (via FTS5 and stigmergy) to gather context and prior art.
2. **P1 BRIDGE (Fabric):** The Web Weaver connects the intent to existing schema, ensuring the request aligns with the braided mission thread.
3. **P2 SHAPE (Creation):** The Mirror Magus constrains the intent into **SBE (Specification by Example) Towers**. The LLM is forced to generate deterministic `Given/When/Then` contracts *before* writing any code.

### Phase 2: Correct by Construction (P4 + P5)
4. **P4 DISRUPT (Adversarial):** The Red Regnant challenges the SBE spec. Are there edge cases? Does it violate invariants? This is the **Red-First** layer of the 6-Defense SDD Stack.
5. **P5 IMMUNIZE (Gating):** The Pyre Praetorian enforces the **Mutation Wall**. The generated artifact must pass Stryker-inspired mutation testing (80-99% confidence). If it fails, the gate closes (Fail-Closed Default).

### Phase 3: MAP-ELITE Evolution (P3 → P6 → P7)
6. **P3 INJECT (Delivery):** The Harmonic Hydra delivers the verified artifact into the active workspace (e.g., the Omega v13 microkernel).
7. **P6 ASSIMILATE (Memory):** The Kraken Keeper extracts the successful pattern as a **Mosaic Tile** (`archetype.<category>.<name>`) and archives it in the SSOT.
8. **P7 NAVIGATE (Steering):** The Spider Sovereign evaluates the new tile against the **MAP-ELITE portfolio**. Does this tile fill a new niche? Does it outperform an existing tile? The portfolio evolves.

## 3. The MAP-ELITE Portfolio of Mosaic Tiles

A standard genetic algorithm optimizes for a single fitness function. **MAP-ELITE** optimizes for diversity and quality across multiple dimensions.

In `HFO_ALTER_REALITY`, every successful execution yields a Mosaic Tile. These tiles are categorized into a multi-dimensional archive based on:
- **Category:** Survival, Growth, Quality, Decision, Anti.
- **Galois Dyad:** Which port pairs it engages (e.g., P0↔P7).
- **TRL (Technology Readiness Level):** 1-9.

### Synergy and Recombination
Because every tile is correct-by-construction (enforced by P4/P5) and adheres to the standard Mosaic Tile schema (Doc 15), they are inherently composable. Future `HFO_ALTER_REALITY` invocations can pull existing elite tiles from the portfolio to assemble complex, SOTA software systems rapidly.

## 4. Execution Flow (The PREY8 Mapping)

The `HFO_ALTER_REALITY` pipeline maps directly to the mandatory PREY8 session protocol:

| PREY8 Step | Pipeline Action | Output |
|------------|-----------------|--------|
| **P**erceive | P0+P6: Ingest intent, query SSOT, load MAP-ELITE portfolio. | Context & Nonce |
| **R**eact | P1+P7: Bridge data, select Meadows L11, plan the evolution. | Strategy & Token |
| **E**xecute | P2+P4: Generate SBE Towers, write code, run adversarial checks. | Artifacts & Tests |
| **Y**ield | P3+P5: Pass mutation gates, extract Mosaic Tile, update portfolio. | Shippable Tile |

---

## 5. Conclusion

Has anyone done a software pipeline like this? 
Yes, evolutionary computation (MAP-ELITE) combined with LLM code generation is cutting-edge AI research (e.g., Eureka by OpenAI/NVIDIA). However, applying it through a **fail-closed, 8-port adversarial lattice** with **SBE/ATDD constraints** is uniquely HFO. 

`HFO_ALTER_REALITY` ensures that the LLM's hallucinatory nature is harnessed for *variation* (the MAP-ELITE mutations), while the deterministic gates ensure *correctness* (the Elite selection).
