## Daily Breakdowns

### 2026-02-20
Here's a concise summary of the key events, actions, and insights for 2026-02-20:

*   **Critical System Compromise & Instability:** The Summoner daemon reported a "CRITICAL" system posture at 00:13:01, indicating the system was under attack and initiating "IMPRISONMENT." This was followed by widespread "Read timed out" errors across all Nataraja commanders (P0-P7) around 01:05 and 01:22, signaling significant communication and processing issues.
*   **Major System Restart:** A major system restart was initiated by Supervisor P7 at approximately 03:55, affecting multiple core daemons (weaver, shaper, injector, singer, dancer, devourer, summoner, kraken) to address the critical instability.
*   **Prey Agent Anomalies:** Prey8 exhibited continuous operational cycles but critically experienced multiple `memory_loss` events and `tamper_alert` signals, suggesting potential instability or external interference.
*   **Kraken Daemon Activity:** The Kraken daemon (P6) remained continuously active throughout the period, performing port classifications for numerous documents, and initiated operations multiple times in the morning (around 07:33, 07:34).

### 2026-02-19
Here's a concise summary of the key events for 2026-02-19:

*   **Agent Processing & System Activity:** The `prey8` agent maintained continuous activity, undergoing multiple full processing cycles orchestrated by the `Singer` component (`hfo.gen89.singer.splendor`).
*   **System Health & Resource Strain:** The system experienced significant resource pressure, including elevated, critical, and throttled states, particularly between 09:50 and 10:16 UTC.
*   **Integrity Concerns:** The `Dancer` daemon reported persistent and increasing "PRISMATIC_WALL" breaches and tamper alerts (from 27 to 33).
*   **Maintenance & Cleanup:** P5-REAPER performed multiple cycles, auto-closing a total of 23 orphaned sessions.
*   **Daemon Deployment & Late-Day Operations:**
    *   Multiple background daemons, including Kraken, were deployed, and `weaver` was successfully summoned by P7 Spell Gate between 21:27 and 21:28.
    *   In the final minutes of the day, `hfo_background_daemon_gen89` conducted "stigmergy-patrol" actions, and `hfo_p6_kraken_daemon_gen89` emitted regular heartbeats.
