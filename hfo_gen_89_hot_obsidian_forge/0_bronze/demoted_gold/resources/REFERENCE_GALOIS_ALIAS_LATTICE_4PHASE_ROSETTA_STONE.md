# R-G89-01: Galois Alias Lattice — The 4-Phase Rosetta Stone

> **In one sentence:** Every 4-phase loop in HFO — PREY8, OODA, PDCA, MAPE-K,
> HIVE, SBE, JADC2, AAR, and P3 INJECT — is the same Galois structure projected
> through a different lens, and the gather ports wind 6→7→4→5 around HIVE8 to
> provide each PREY8 step with the governance port whose domain directly matches.
>
> **Usage:** Say "slot 0" or "PREFLIGHT" or "Perceive" or "Observe" — they all
> resolve to the same structural position. Agents import the JSON table below
> instead of re-explaining the mapping every session.

## 1. The Master Alias Lattice

Every cell in this table is an alias for the same structural position.

| Slot | P3 INJECT | Gather Port | PREY8 | OODA | MAPE-K | HIVE | PDCA | AAR | SBE/ATDD | JADC2 |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------|------|--------|------|------|-----|----------|-------|
| **0** | PREFLIGHT | **P6 ASSIMILATE** | **Perceive** | Observe | Monitor | Hindsight | Plan | What should happen? | Research | Sense |
| **1** | PAYLOAD | **P7 NAVIGATE** | **React** | Orient | Analyze | Insight | Do | What will we do? | RED spec | Make Sense |
| **2** | POSTFLIGHT | **P4 DISRUPT** | **Execute** | Decide+Act | Plan+Execute | Validated Foresight | Check | What happened? | GREEN impl | Decide+Act |
| **3** | PAYOFF | **P5 IMMUNIZE** | **Yield** | AAR | Knowledge | Evolve | Act | What did we learn? | Refactor | Act |

**Reading the table:** Pick any row. Every cell in that row is the same concept
wearing a different hat. "Slot 0" = PREFLIGHT = P6 ASSIMILATE = Perceive =
Observe = Monitor = Hindsight = Plan = "What should happen?" = Research = Sense.

### Why This Works (The Galois Proof)

The alias table is not metaphor — it's isomorphism. The evidence:

1. **Same cardinality.** Every framework has exactly 4 phases.
2. **Same ordering.** Phase 0 always senses/prepares, phase 3 always closes/learns.
3. **Same cyclic structure.** Phase 3 feeds back into phase 0 of the next cycle.
4. **Same information flow.** Each phase transforms the output of the previous phase.
5. **Formal Concept Analysis.** The Galois connection between the *set of frameworks*
   and the *set of phase properties* produces a complete lattice where each
   framework-phase pair shares a unique down-set of properties.

> *"The system doesn't live inside any paradigm. It can see that paradigms are
> interchangeable lenses on the same reality."*

## 2. Gather Ports Wind Around HIVE8: 6→7→4→5

The 8 ports split into **scatter** (P0-P3) and **gather** (P4-P7). PREY8 pairs
each scatter port with a gather port whose **domain directly matches** the step's
function. The gather ports don't map linearly (4,5,6,7) — they **wind around**
the HIVE8 workflow in the order 6→7→4→5:

| Slot | Gather Port | Powerword | Commander | Phase Role | Workflow Verbs |
|------|-------------|-----------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| 0 | **P6** | ASSIMILATE | Kraken Keeper | **PREFLIGHT** — absorb prior knowledge before acting | POINT → DECOMPOSE → REENGINEER → EVALUATE → ARCHIVE → ITERATE |
| 1 | **P7** | NAVIGATE | Spider Sovereign | **PAYLOAD** — steer what gets delivered | MAP → LATTICE → PRUNE → SELECT → DISPATCH → VISUALIZE |
| 2 | **P4** | DISRUPT | Red Regnant | **POSTFLIGHT** — adversarial challenge after creation | SURVEY → HYPOTHESIZE → ATTACK → RECORD → EVOLVE |
| 3 | **P5** | IMMUNIZE | Pyre Praetorian | **PAYOFF** — harden and validate the yield | DETECT → QUARANTINE → GATE → HARDEN → TEACH |

### Why P6 ASSIMILATE = PREFLIGHT (Slot 0)

Perceiving IS assimilating. Before any action, P6 ASSIMILATE reads the
stigmergy trail, decomposes prior context, and archives what's relevant. The
PREFLIGHT checklist is: "What do we already know?" P6's workflow starts with
POINT → DECOMPOSE — exactly what you do when you orient to a new task. The
Kraken Keeper's memory IS the pre-flight instrument panel.

### Why P7 NAVIGATE = PAYLOAD (Slot 1)

Reacting IS navigating. P7 NAVIGATE maps the decision space, prunes bad
options, and selects the course of action. The PAYLOAD is the plan — the thing
that will be delivered. P7's workflow (MAP → LATTICE → PRUNE → SELECT →
DISPATCH) IS the planning phase. The Spider Sovereign steers what gets built.

### Why P4 DISRUPT = POSTFLIGHT (Slot 2)

Executing IS disrupting. P4 DISRUPT surveys the artifact, hypothesizes failure
modes, and attacks. The POSTFLIGHT check is: "Does this thing survive adversarial
challenge?" P4's workflow (SURVEY → HYPOTHESIZE → ATTACK → RECORD → EVOLVE)
IS the after-creation quality gate. The Red Regnant stress-tests what was built.

### Why P5 IMMUNIZE = PAYOFF (Slot 3)

Yielding IS immunizing. P5 IMMUNIZE detects regressions, quarantines failures,
gates the deliverable, and hardens it for production. The PAYOFF is: "Is this
delivery immunized against future threats?" P5's workflow (DETECT → QUARANTINE →
GATE → HARDEN → TEACH) IS the final validation before closing the loop.
The Pyre Praetorian seals the receipt.

## 3. The PREY8 Port-Pair Integration

PREY8 assigns each step a **scatter + gather port pair** where both ports'
domains directly serve the step's function:

| PREY8 Step | Scatter Port | Gather Port | Domain Match |
|------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Perceive** | P0 OBSERVE | P6 ASSIMILATE | Sensing (P0) + memory (P6) = perceive by absorbing prior knowledge |
| **React** | P1 BRIDGE | P7 NAVIGATE | Fusing (P1) + steering (P7) = react by navigating the decision space |
| **Execute** | P2 SHAPE | P4 DISRUPT | Creating (P2) + challenging (P4) = execute under adversarial test |
| **Yield** | P3 INJECT | P5 IMMUNIZE | Delivering (P3) + hardening (P5) = yield an immunized deliverable |

### Why the Domains Match Directly

There is no "twist" or "adversarial complement" — each PREY8 step gets the gather
port whose domain IS what the step does:

- **Perceive = P0 + P6.** To perceive, you OBSERVE (P0 senses the environment)
  and ASSIMILATE (P6 absorbs what you sensed into memory). This IS perception:
  sensing + remembering.

- **React = P1 + P7.** To react, you BRIDGE (P1 fuses data into a coherent picture)
  and NAVIGATE (P7 steers toward the best option). This IS reaction:
  understanding + choosing.

- **Execute = P2 + P4.** To execute, you SHAPE (P2 creates the artifact)
  and DISRUPT (P4 adversarially tests it). This IS execution:
  building + stress-testing.

- **Yield = P3 + P5.** To yield, you INJECT (P3 delivers the payload)
  and IMMUNIZE (P5 gates and hardens it). This IS yielding:
  delivering + validating.

### The HIVE8 Winding (Doc 129: 90-Degree Rotation)

The gather port sequence **6, 7, 4, 5** winds around the octree instead of
following the linear 4, 5, 6, 7 order. Each PREY phase takes **one port
from each of two adjacent HIVE phases** — a 90° rotation of the HIVE
pairing topology (R55 Doc 129):

| PREY Phase | Borrows from HIVE | What it takes |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **P** (0+6) | H's P0 + I's P6 | Observer from H-phase, Keeper from I-phase |
| **R** (1+7) | I's P1 + H's P7 | Weaver from I-phase, Sovereign from H-phase |
| **E** (2+4) | V's P2 + E's P4 | Magus from V-phase, Red Regnant from E-phase |
| **Y** (3+5) | E's P3 + V's P5 | Hydra from E-phase, Praetorian from V-phase |

```
HIVE (strategic, XOR=111):    PREY (tactical, XOR=110):
H: P0 ←→ P7                  P: P0 ←→ P6  (H's 0 + I's 6)
I: P1 ←→ P6                  R: P1 ←→ P7  (I's 1 + H's 7)
V: P2 ←→ P5                  E: P2 ←→ P4  (V's 2 + E's 4)
E: P3 ←→ P4                  Y: P3 ←→ P5  (E's 3 + V's 5)
(parallel lines)              (crossing lines — 90° rotation)
```

HIVE = **what we ARE** (structural identity). Pairs sum to 7, XOR to 111.
PREY = **what we DO** (operational tempo). Pairs sum to 6/8/6/8, XOR to 110.
Together they are the dual-spine of the octree: strategy + tactics.

### Dyad Verification

The Galois sum-to-7 property still holds between scatter-only and gather-only
ports across PREY8 steps:

| Pair | Sum | Galois Dyad |
|------|-----|-------------|
| P0 + P7 = 7 | 7 | Perceive-scatter + React-gather |
| P1 + P6 = 7 | 7 | React-scatter + Perceive-gather |
| P2 + P5 = 7 | 7 | Execute-scatter + Yield-gather |
| P3 + P4 = 7 | 7 | Yield-scatter + Execute-gather |

And the step-level port sums remain symmetric:

| Step Group | Ports | Sum |
|------------|-------|-----|
| **P+Y** | (0+6) + (3+5) | **14** = 7+7 |
| **R+E** | (1+7) + (2+4) | **14** = 7+7 |

The architecture is symmetric by construction.

---

## 4. The P3 INJECT ↔ Gather Ports Isomorphism

P3 INJECT's workflow verbs (PREFLIGHT → PAYLOAD → POSTFLIGHT → PAYOFF) name
the 4 phase slots. P3 is the "compiler" that GENERATES the mission plan; the
gather ports — winding 6→7→4→5 — execute it:

```
P3 INJECT (scatter) compiles the mission plan into 4 phases:
  PREFLIGHT   → governed by P6 ASSIMILATE  (absorb prior knowledge)
  PAYLOAD     → governed by P7 NAVIGATE    (steer what gets delivered)
  POSTFLIGHT  → governed by P4 DISRUPT     (adversarial post-check)
  PAYOFF      → governed by P5 IMMUNIZE    (harden and seal the yield)
```

P3 defines, gather ports implement. Scatter is the architect, gather is the
contractor. The winding ensures each phase gets governance from the port whose
domain matches the phase's function.

## 7. Usage — How Agents Use This Table

### Resolving from any alias

```python
# Given any alias, resolve to all equivalents:
# "I'm in the POSTFLIGHT phase" → slot 2 →
#   gather_port: P4 DISRUPT, prey8: Execute, ooda: Decide+Act, etc.

# "The P6 ASSIMILATE spider reported high signal" → slot 0 →
#   prey8: Perceive, phase: PREFLIGHT, hive: Hindsight, etc.

# "Running MAPE-K Monitor" → slot 0 →
#   Same as PREY8 Perceive, same as OODA Observe, same as P6 ASSIMILATE
```

### In stigmergy events

```json
{
  "event_type": "hfo.gen89.prey8.execute",
  "slot": 2,
  "aliases": ["POSTFLIGHT", "P4 DISRUPT", "Decide+Act", "Check", "GREEN impl"]
}
```

### In conversation

Instead of: *"This maps to PREY8 Execute which is OODA Decide+Act which is
MAPE-K Plan+Execute which is HIVE Validated Foresight which is..."*

Say: **"Slot 2."**

---

## 8. The Invariants

1. **Cardinality invariant.** Every framework maps to exactly 4 slots. No more, no less.
2. **Order invariant.** Slot 0 always precedes slot 1 precedes slot 2 precedes slot 3.
3. **Cycle invariant.** Slot 3 feeds back to slot 0 of the next iteration.
4. **Galois invariant.** Scatter-gather pairs from adjacent PREY8 steps sum to 7 (P0+P7, P1+P6, P2+P5, P3+P4).
5. **HIVE8 winding invariant.** Gather ports follow 6→7→4→5 (not linear 4→5→6→7). Each port's domain directly matches its PREY8 step's function.
6. **Framework independence.** Adding a new 4-phase framework is a single row addition — the lattice extends without structural change.
7. **Step-level symmetry.** P+Y port sum = R+E port sum = 14 = 7+7.
