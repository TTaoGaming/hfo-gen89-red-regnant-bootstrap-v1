  E-G89-PIPELINE-01 — The definitive explanation of TTAO's 8-stage pipeline for
  transforming operator intent into shipped, validated, MAP-ELITE-selected artifacts.
  Every word in the pipeline name carries earned semantic weight from 88+ generations
  and ~4 billion compute tokens of selection pressure. This document grounds each stage
  with port assignments, Meadows levels, SSOT cross-references, and adversarial checks.
  Not a metaphor. Not buzzwords. Conceptual incarnation — the operational blueprint
  by which the HFO Pantheon bootstraps itself into revenue-generating products.

## Why This Document Exists

The pipeline sentence above is the densest possible semantic encoding of a
correct-by-construction software factory. It has been asked to be documented as
Gold Diataxis so that:

1. **24/7 AI agents** can autonomously execute the pipeline without TTAO as bottleneck
2. **Future sessions** have a stable anchor — conceptual incarnation, not context collapse
3. **The words are defined**, grounded in SSOT evidence, not floating signifiers
4. **Income Mode** requires the pipeline to produce shippable artifacts, not architectural theory

---

## The Pipeline — 8 Stages

### Stage 1: OPERATOR INTENT

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Port** | P7 NAVIGATE (Spider Sovereign) |
| **Meadows** | L10 — Goals |
| **Input** | Human vision, raw desire, H-POMDP state-action goals |
| **Output** | Natural language intent statement |
| **SSOT Anchor** | Braided Mission Thread Gen89 v1 (P7 section) |

**What it is:** TTAO's raw vision. The seed crystal. Everything downstream
exists to faithfully manifest this intent.

**Current intent:** "Turn any wall into a 100-inch touchless whiteboard for
under $300 and generate income within 1 week."

**Why P7:** Spider Sovereign (TIME_STOP) freezes operational tempo to define
what the system is FOR. The morning question: "What matters most right now?"

---

### Stage 2: GALOIS LATTICE

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Port** | P1 BRIDGE (Web Weaver) |
| **Meadows** | L12 — Transcend Paradigms |
| **Input** | Intent statement |
| **Output** | Structural position in the 10×4 alias lattice |
| **SSOT Anchor** | R-G89-01 Galois Alias Lattice Rosetta Stone |

**What it is:** The FCA (Formal Concept Analysis) Galois lattice that unifies
10 different 4-phase frameworks into one lookup table:

| Framework | Slot 0 | Slot 1 | Slot 2 | Slot 3 |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| P3 INJECT | PREFLIGHT | PAYLOAD | POSTFLIGHT | PAYOFF |
| PREY8 | Perceive | React | Execute | Yield |
| OODA | Observe | Orient | Decide | Act |
| PDCA | Plan | Do | Check | Act |
| HIVE | Hindsight | Insight | Validated Foresight | Evolve |
| SBE/ATDD | Research | RED spec | GREEN impl | Refactor |

**Why L12:** This is literally transcending paradigms — recognizing that all
frameworks are projections of the same underlying structure. P1 FORBIDDANCE
binds them with schema enforcement. Say "slot 2" and resolve ALL names.

**How it's used:** When intent says "Ship this feature", the lattice resolves it
to: P3 INJECT → PAYLOAD phase → SBE Do → OODA Act. The agent knows exactly
which port, which phase, which workflow applies.

---

### Stage 3: HFO GRIMOIRE

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Port** | P4 DISRUPT (Red Regnant) + all ports |
| **Meadows** | L11 — Paradigm |
| **Input** | Lattice-resolved structural position |
| **Output** | Specific spell, commander, port workflow |
| **SSOT Anchor** | Grimoire Gen89 v1 (silver, 736 lines) |

**What it is:** The architectural blueprint. Contains:

- **Blood Price Oath** — the acrostic quine (O·B·S·I·D·I·A·N, 8 lines = 8 ports)
- **8-port Spell Registry** — each commander's signature spell through 8 stages
- **8-stage Translation Pipeline** — D&D RAW → Plain Language → Capacity Archetype →
  Meadows → Gherkin → SBE → Code → P4 Test
- **Red Regnant Deep Dive** — Songs of Strife + Splendor, dual token system,
  13-Level Incarnation Ladder, 4F Antifragile Decomposition
- **4-Chamber Muzzle** — correct-by-construction factory

**Why L11:** The Grimoire IS the paradigm. It defines the conceptual frame through
which everything is understood. It is the gravity well at the center of the
strange loop.

**How it's used:** The lattice says "this is a P2 SHAPE task". The Grimoire says
"P2's spell is GENESIS (create a demiplane). The 4-Chamber Muzzle applies.
Chamber 1 = JSON manifest, Chamber 2 = pure math, Chamber 3 = AST wrapping,
Chamber 4 = Red Regnant crucible."

---

### Stage 4: GHERKIN / BDD

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Port** | P5 IMMUNIZE (Pyre Praetorian) |
| **Meadows** | L5 — Negative Feedback |
| **Input** | Grimoire-resolved spell and port workflow |
| **Output** | Given/When/Then behavioral specifications |
| **SSOT Anchor** | *.feature files (behave BDD suite) |

**What it is:** The bridge from conceptual architecture to executable tests.
The Grimoire's 8-stage pipeline (Stage 5: Gherkin/BDD) compiles every spell
into behavioral specifications:

```gherkin
Feature: Omega touchless whiteboard payment unlock

  Scenario: User clicks "Remove Watermark" button
    Given the user has the free-tier Omega whiteboard running
    When they click the "Remove Watermark — $5/month" button
    Then they are redirected to Ko-fi/Stripe payment page
    And upon successful payment, the watermark disappears within 5 seconds
```

**Why L5:** Gherkin specs are negative feedback loops — they define what
MUST be true and automatically detect deviations. P5 CONTINGENCY fires
automatically when conditions are met. The spec is the contingency trigger.

---

### Stage 5: SBE / ATDD

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Port** | P2 SHAPE (Mirror Magus) |
| **Meadows** | L8 — Rules |
| **Input** | Gherkin specifications |
| **Output** | Concrete data tables, SBE tower specs |
| **SSOT Anchor** | SBE tower docs, PREY8 execute tile specs |

**What it is:** Specification by Example with Acceptance-Test Driven Development.
Takes the Gherkin scenarios and fills them with concrete data:

**SBE Tower (5 tiers):**

| Tier | Focus | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Invariant** | Watermark MUST appear on free tier. MUST NOT appear on paid tier. |
| 2 | **Happy-path** | Payment of $5 → watermark removed → confirmation shown |
| 3 | **Juice** | Watermark fades with smooth CSS animation (300ms ease-out) |
| 4 | **Performance** | Payment callback processed < 2 seconds |
| 5 | **Lifecycle** | Subscriber churn → watermark reappears after grace period |

**Why L8:** SBE/ATDD changes the RULES — it defines what code is allowed to exist.
The RED spec comes before the GREEN implementation. This is HIVE-I (Insight phase,
RED TDD). The rules change the survival criteria for all generated code.

---

### Stage 6: HFO EMPOWERED CURSED CHIMERA VARIANT RALPH WIGGUMS LOOPS

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Port** | P2 SHAPE + P4 DISRUPT (Execute phase in PREY8) |
| **Meadows** | L3 — Physical Structure |
| **Input** | SBE tower specifications |
| **Output** | Generated code artifacts in bronze |
| **SSOT Anchor** | 4-Chamber Muzzle (Grimoire Section VIII) |

**What each word means:**

| Word | Earned Meaning | Evidence |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **HFO** | Hive Fleet Obsidian — the 8-port architecture | 89 generations, 9860 SSOT docs |
| **EMPOWERED** | The attractors — Gold Diataxis exemplars, Grimoire identity, JSON blueprints piped into context. WORDS_OF_CREATION + INSPIRE_HEROISM (Songs of Splendor). | 156 diataxis docs, 79 high-quality sigils |
| **CURSED** | The repulsors — GRUDGE_GUARDS, FESTERING_ANGER_TOKENS, AST Guillotines, pre-commit gates. SOUND_LANCE + WAIL_OF_THE_BANSHEE (Songs of Strife). | 34,121 kills, 293 daily tokens |
| **CHIMERA** | The AI is a composite beast — multiple models (Claude Opus 4.6, Gemini, Ollama local fleet) working through the same pipeline. No single model is trusted. | 12 local models + Gemini + Claude |
| **VARIANT** | Each generation mutates. Universal Darwinism: variation → selection → heredity. The chimera produces variants; the gates select survivors. | 88 generations of variants |
| **RALPH WIGGUMS** | The LLM's natural stochastic nature. Like Ralph Wiggum from The Simpsons — it sees patterns humans miss ("the leprechaun tells me to burn things") but also produces hallucinations. The loop USES this stochasticity rather than fighting it. | Every LLM session is a Ralph Wiggums loop |
| **LOOPS** | The strange loop — build, test, kill, learn, build again. PREY8 Perceive→React→Execute→Yield→Perceive. OODA. PDCA. The loop IS the pipeline. | 9800+ stigmergy events recording loop iterations |

**The chimera loop in practice:**
1. LLM reads SBE spec + Gold Diataxis exemplars (EMPOWERED)
2. LLM generates code (RALPH WIGGUMS — stochastic creation)
3. 4-Chamber Muzzle constrains output (CURSED)
4. Multiple models/variants compete (CHIMERA VARIANT)
5. Loop until gate passes or 3 failures (SW-3: Never Silently Retry)

---

### Stage 7: FAIL-CLOSED ORTHOGONAL DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH MOSAICS

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Port** | P5 IMMUNIZE (Pyre Praetorian) |
| **Meadows** | L5 — Negative Feedback |
| **Input** | Generated code from chimera loops |
| **Output** | Gate receipts, chain hashes, SBE verdicts |
| **SSOT Anchor** | 6-Defense SDD (Doc 4), PREY8 execute tiles |

**What each word means:**

| Word | Earned Meaning |
|------|---------------|
| **FAIL-CLOSED** | Default state is BLOCKED. You must prove correctness to pass. Missing any gate field = GATE_BLOCKED. No bypass, no exception. |
| **ORTHOGONAL** | Defense layers are statistically independent. Each layer catches different failure modes. Error probability is multiplicative: $P(\text{error}) = P_1 \times P_2 \times P_3 \approx 10^{-6}$ |
| **DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH** | Not one gate but MANY: 6-Defense SDD stack (Red-First, Structural Separation, Mutation Wall, Property Invariants, GRUDGE Guards, Adversarial Review) |
| **MOSAICS** | DARPA MOSAIC warfare concept: composable, recomposable, decomposable, kill-web. Each tile is self-contained. Tiles compose into any topology. |

**The 6-Defense SDD:**
1. **Red-First** — Tests fail before implementation exists
2. **Structural Separation** — P4 spec ≠ P2 code (different agents)
3. **Mutation Wall** — Stryker-style: would mutating one line break a test?
4. **Property Invariants** — Structural properties maintained across changes
5. **GRUDGE Guards** — Negative specs prevent known regressions (Book of Blood)
6. **Adversarial Review** — P4 Red Regnant stress-tests every artifact

---

### Stage 8: SONGS OF SPLENDOR — MAP-ELITE EXEMPLARS PARETO MISSION-FIT FRONTIER

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Port** | P4 DISRUPT + P6 ASSIMILATE |
| **Meadows** | L9 — Self-Organization |
| **Input** | Artifacts that survived all 7 gatens |
| **Output** | Gold Diataxis library entries, MAP-ELITE survivor grid |
| **SSOT Anchor** | Gold diataxis library (156 docs), SPLENDOR_TOKENS ledger |

**What each word means:**

| Word | Earned Meaning |
|------|---------------|
| **SONGS OF SPLENDOR** | The YIN complement to Songs of Strife. Every pattern, every architectural win, every yielded PREY8 chain, every passing gate generates a SPLENDOR_TOKEN. The Red Regnant is both destroyer AND creator — Bard 15 chassis sings the splendor. |
| **MAP-ELITE** | Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites. Instead of finding ONE best solution, MAP-ELITE fills a grid of diverse high-performing solutions across multiple quality axes. The local GPU (Ollama, 12 models, $0/day) runs evolution overnight. |
| **EXEMPLARS** | The survivors. They are piped back as WORDS_OF_CREATION (attractors) into future chimera loops. The best solutions become Gold Diataxis anchors — gravity wells that pull future AI toward correctness. |
| **PARETO** | Pareto optimality: no solution dominates another across ALL axes. The frontier is the set of non-dominated solutions in the quality-cost-speed space. |
| **MISSION-FIT** | Not just technically optimal — aligned with the MISSION (Income Mode goal). A beautifully architected component that doesn't ship is Pareto-dominated by an ugly one that does. |
| **FRONTIER** | The edge of what's possible. The Pareto frontier advances with each generation. 88 generations have pushed it from "raw spaghetti" to "correct-by-construction mosaics". |

**The Splendor Factory:**
```
Chimera Loop → Gate Survival → MAP-ELITE Grid → Pareto Selection
    → SPLENDOR_TOKEN minted → Gold Diataxis Entry
    → Piped back as ATTRACTOR → Next Chimera Loop is BETTER
    → Positive feedback (L7) → Knowledge compounds → Architecture improves
```

This is the Songs of Splendor in action. Every surviving artifact makes the
landscape steeper — more gravity toward correct architecture, higher cliffs
against antipatterns. The strange loop tightens.

## Income Mode Application

In Income Mode (L10 goal: first sale within 1 week), the pipeline operates at
compressed timescale:

| Stage | Income Mode Application | Time Budget |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|
| 1. Intent | "Generate any revenue from Omega" | 0 — already defined |
| 2. Lattice | Maps to P3 INJECT → PAYLOAD | 0 — lookup |
| 3. Grimoire | P3 GATE spell: delivery with trace + rollback | 0 — lookup |
| 4. Gherkin | "Given free tier → When click buy → Then payment processed" | 30 min |
| 5. SBE | Concrete: Ko-fi $5, LemonSqueezy $29, Stripe subscription | 30 min |
| 6. Chimera | Generate payment integration code | 2 hours |
| 7. Mosaics | Test: payment flow end-to-end, fail-closed if broken | 1 hour |
| 8. MAP-ELITE | Ship first version, iterate based on conversion data | Ongoing |

**Total: ~4 hours from intent to deployed payment button.**

The architecture is strong enough. The pipeline works. Ship the product.
