# Explanation: The Obsidian Octave and Galois Lattice

The core of the Hive Fleet Obsidian (HFO) architecture is the **Obsidian Octave**—an 8-port system that categorizes all operations, capabilities, and agents. 

## The 8 Ports and Their Commanders

| Port | Power Word | Commander | Domain |
|------|------------|-----------|--------|
| **P0** | OBSERVE | Lidless Legion | Sensing under contest |
| **P1** | BRIDGE | Web Weaver | Shared data fabric |
| **P2** | SHAPE | Mirror Magus | Creation / models |
| **P3** | INJECT | Harmonic Hydra | Payload delivery |
| **P4** | DISRUPT | Red Regnant | Red team / probing |
| **P5** | IMMUNIZE | Pyre Praetorian | Blue team / gates |
| **P6** | ASSIMILATE | Kraken Keeper | Learning / memory |
| **P7** | NAVIGATE | Spider Sovereign | C2 / steering |

## The Galois Lattice (Anti-Diagonal Dyads)

The 8 ports are not isolated; they are structurally paired. The **Galois Lattice** pairs ports by architectural complement, where the sum of the port numbers always equals 7 ($P_i + P_{7-i} = 7$).

1. **P0 ↔ P7 (Watcher ↔ Summoner):** Sight feeds sovereignty. The Watcher perceives; the Summoner weaves perception into command.
2. **P1 ↔ P6 (Binder ↔ Devourer):** Bonds feed depths. The Binder seals covenants; the Devourer consumes and becomes them.
3. **P2 ↔ P5 (Maker ↔ Dancer):** Myths survive fire or die. The Maker shapes from nothing; the Dancer burns what can't survive.
4. **P3 ↔ P4 (Harbinger ↔ Singer):** Harmony meets strife. The Harbinger delivers; the Singer tests whether it was worth delivering.

## The PREY8 Port-Pair Gates

While the Galois Lattice pairs ports by architectural complement, the **PREY8** loop pairs them by workflow adjacency. This creates an orthogonal matrix of relationships.

1. **PERCEIVE (P0 + P6):** OBSERVE + ASSIMILATE. You cannot perceive without both sensing the present (P0) and remembering the past (P6).
2. **REACT (P1 + P7):** BRIDGE + NAVIGATE. You cannot form a strategy without connecting data (P1) and steering the system (P7).
3. **EXECUTE (P2 + P4):** SHAPE + DISRUPT. You cannot create (P2) without simultaneously subjecting the creation to adversarial testing (P4).
4. **YIELD (P3 + P5):** INJECT + IMMUNIZE. You cannot deliver a payload (P3) without verifying it passes the immune system gates (P5).

Notice the symmetry: 
- Perceive + Yield = (0+6) + (3+5) = 14 = 7+7.
- React + Execute = (1+7) + (2+4) = 14 = 7+7.

The architecture is symmetric and correct-by-construction.
